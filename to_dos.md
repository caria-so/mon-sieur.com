  - Caching: Redis vs in-memory vs CDN edge caching
  - Notifications: Firebase vs Apple Push Notification service


  # Graph weighting solution
  ⏺ I propose creating a Graph Weighting Engine that extends the heatmap logic to resolve conflicts
  between different magical correspondences. Here's the plan:

  Proposed Solution: Astrological Graph Weighting System

  1. Correspondence Confidence Scores

  Each graph edge gets a confidence score based on:

  class GraphWeightingEngine:

      def calculate_correspondence_confidence(self, relationship_type, source_planet, target_entity, 
  current_context):
          """
          Calculate how confident we are in a magical correspondence given current astrological 
  context
          
          Args:
              relationship_type: "HOUR_RULED_BY", "DAY_RULED_BY", "HAS_ANALOGY_WITH", etc.
              source_planet: The planetary ruler 
              target_entity: Angel, metal, color, etc.
              current_context: Current planetary positions, hour/day rulers
          """
          base_confidence = 1.0

          # 1. TEMPORAL PRIMACY (most important)
          if relationship_type == "HOUR_RULED_BY":
              base_confidence = 10.0  # Hour takes precedence
          elif relationship_type == "DAY_RULED_BY":
              base_confidence = 6.0   # Day is secondary
          elif relationship_type == "HAS_ANALOGY_WITH":
              base_confidence = 3.0   # General correspondences are tertiary

          # 2. PLANETARY STRENGTH (reuse heatmap logic)
          planet_intensity = self.get_planet_intensity(source_planet, current_context)
          strength_multiplier = planet_intensity / 5.0  # Normalize to ~2x max

          # 3. DIGNITY MODIFIER
          dignity_modifier = self.calculate_dignity_modifier(source_planet, current_context)

          # 4. CONFLICT PENALTIES
          conflict_penalty = self.calculate_conflict_penalty(
              source_planet, target_entity, current_context
          )

          final_confidence = base_confidence * strength_multiplier * dignity_modifier -
  conflict_penalty
          return max(final_confidence, 0.1)  # Never go below 0.1

  2. Conflict Resolution Hierarchy

  def resolve_planetary_conflicts(self, graph_data, current_context):
      """
      When multiple planets claim the same correspondence, resolve based on astrological strength
      """

      # Group by target entity (e.g., all relationships pointing to "Gabriel" angel)
      entity_groups = self.group_by_target_entity(graph_data)

      for entity, relationships in entity_groups.items():
          if len(relationships) > 1:  # Conflict detected

              # Calculate confidence for each relationship
              weighted_relationships = []
              for rel in relationships:
                  confidence = self.calculate_correspondence_confidence(
                      rel["relationship_type"],
                      rel["source_planet"],
                      entity,
                      current_context
                  )
                  weighted_relationships.append({
                      **rel,
                      "confidence": confidence,
                      "conflict_resolution": "primary" if confidence == max([r["confidence"] for r in
  weighted_relationships]) else "secondary"
                  })

              # Mark winner and losers
              winner = max(weighted_relationships, key=lambda x: x["confidence"])
              for rel in weighted_relationships:
                  rel["is_primary_influence"] = (rel == winner)
                  rel["strength_rank"] = self.rank_by_confidence(weighted_relationships)

      return graph_data

  3. Specific Astrological Rules

  def calculate_conflict_penalty(self, planet, target_entity, context):
      """
      Apply specific astrological conflict penalties
      """
      penalty = 0

      hour_ruler = context["hour_ruler"]
      day_ruler = context["day_ruler"]

      # Rule 1: If day ruler conflicts with hour ruler for same correspondence
      if planet == day_ruler and hour_ruler != day_ruler:
          if self.entity_also_ruled_by(target_entity, hour_ruler):
              penalty += 3.0  # Day ruler gets penalty when hour ruler also claims it

      # Rule 2: Combust planets lose authority over their correspondences
      if context["planets"][planet].get("is_combust"):
          penalty += 2.0

      # Rule 3: Retrograde planets have reduced influence over time-sensitive correspondences
      if context["planets"][planet].get("is_retrograde"):
          if target_entity.type in ["Angel", "Hour"]:
              penalty += 1.0

      # Rule 4: Below horizon planets lose influence over "active" correspondences
      if context["planets"][planet].get("altitude", 0) < 0:
          if target_entity.type in ["Angel", "Action", "Ritual"]:
              penalty += 1.5

      return penalty

  4. Integration with Current System

  We can extend the existing Neo4j query in neo4j_queries.py:

  def fetch_hour_data_with_weights(self, hour_name, planetary_positions):
      """
      Enhanced version that includes astrological weighting
      """
      # Get raw graph data (existing code)
      raw_data = self.fetch_hour_data(hour_name, planetary_positions)

      # Apply astrological weighting
      weighting_engine = GraphWeightingEngine()
      weighted_data = weighting_engine.resolve_planetary_conflicts(
          raw_data,
          {
              "hour_ruler": self.get_hour_ruler(hour_name),
              "day_ruler": self.get_day_ruler(planetary_positions),
              "planets": planetary_positions
          }
      )

      # Sort connections by confidence
      weighted_data["connections"].sort(key=lambda x: x.get("confidence", 0), reverse=True)

      return weighted_data

  5. Frontend Implications

  The weighted graph can then show:
  - Primary influences (thick borders, full opacity)
  - Secondary influences (thin borders, reduced opacity)
  - Conflict indicators (warning icons when multiple planets claim same correspondence)
  - Confidence meters (strength bars next to each correspondence)

  Would you like me to start implementing this Graph Weighting Engine? I think we should:

  1. Create graph_weighting_engine.py
  2. Extend the existing neo4j_queries.py to use it
  3. Update the frontend to display confidence scores

  This would solve the astrological conflict problem while reusing all the sophisticated planetary
  strength calculations from the heatmap system.



  # Graph proximity

  Ah, excellent point! Graph vicinity - the network distance/proximity in the graph structure itself
  should absolutely be a weighting factor!

  So we need to consider:

  1. Astrological strength (what we discussed - planetary dignities, hour/day rulers, etc.)
  2. Elemental dominance (current elemental "weather" favoring aligned correspondences)
  3. Graph vicinity (how close things are in the network topology)

  For graph vicinity, we could weight based on:

  - Direct connections (1 hop): Highest weight
  - 2-hop connections (connected through 1 intermediary): Medium weight
  - 3+ hops: Lower weights, exponentially decreasing

  Example: If current hour ruler is Mars, then:
  - Mars → Iron (direct connection): Full weight
  - Mars → Fire → Red (2 hops): Medium weight
  - Mars → Fire → Red → Ruby (3 hops): Lower weight

  This makes sense astrologically too - closer correspondences in the magical system should have
  stronger influence than distant chain connections.

  Should I design a Graph Proximity Calculator that:
  1. Uses BFS/Dijkstra to find shortest paths from hour/day rulers
  2. Applies distance decay to correspondence weights
  3. Combines with astrological strength and elemental dominance?

  This would create a true multi-dimensional weighting system: Astrology × Elements × Graph Distance.


## More complex use cases: 

### Hour ruling planet ≠ Day ruling planet
Let's expand on the simple use case:
Example: If current hour on a Saturday is ruled by Mars, then we'd have:
  - Mars → Sachiel direct connection: full weight
  - Mars → Tuesday direct connection full weight 

but we are on Saturday! 
Saturday and its connections must have their place.
