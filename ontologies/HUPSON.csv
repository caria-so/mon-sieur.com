Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens, and ordinarily its members are transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Coxsackieviruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus.

Coxsackieviruses are among the leading causes of aseptic meningitis, the other usual suspects are echovirus and mumps virus.

All suids are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia and its islands, to Europe, and Africa.

The earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch of Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene.[1] Several fossil species are known, and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodon).[2]

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00001202,_Wang-Landau sampling,,"The Wang and Landau algorithm proposed by Fugao Wang and David P. Landau[1] is an extension of Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling. It is designed to calculate the density of states of a computer-simulated system, such as an Ising model of spin glasses, or model atoms in a molecular force field. The idea of the method is to build the density of states using the fact that a system, when being simulated, is generating its density of states. It is the general method to obtain the DOS in a multicanonical simulation.

Initially designed for physical systems, the Metropolis Monte Carlo method was based on Boltzmann's insight that at a given temperature molecules are distributed between high energy, or unfavorable states, and low energy, or favorable states, with a probability given by both the energy difference and the density of states. Thus if there is an extremely large number of less-favored states, the less-favored states will dominate, if the temperature is sufficiently high to overcome the energy difference. This is seen, for instance, when wax melts. At a low temperature only the favorable, solid states are reachable. As temperature rises, a huge number of less favored states becomes possible, and the solid turns into a liquid.

In principle the Wang-Landau algorithm can be applied to any system which is characterized by a cost (or energy) function. For instance, it has been applied to the solution of numerical integrals[2] and the folding of proteins.[3]

The structure of the FMO complex is trimeric (C3-symmetry) and each of the three monomers contains eight bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) molecules, which are bound to the protein scaffold via ligation of their central magnesium atom either to amino acids of the protein (mostly histidine) or water-bridged oxygen atoms (only one BChl a of each monomer).

Since the structure of the FMO complex is available, one can try to calculate structure based optical spectra in comparison with experimental optical spectra.[3][4] In the simplest case only the excitonic coupling of the BChls is taken into account,[5] while more realistic theories also consider the pigment-protein coupling.[6] A very important property is the local transition energy (site energy) of the BChls, which is different for each of them, due to their individual local protein invironment. The site energies of the BChls determine the direction of the energy flow. There is some structural information on the FMO-RC super complex available, which has been obtained by electron microscopy[7][8] and linear dichroism spectra measured on FMO trimers and FMO-RC complexes. From these measurements, two possible orientations of the FMO complex relative to the RC are possible. Recently it was possible to decide which of the one orientations is useful for efficient energy transfer,[9] namely the orientation with BChl 3 and 4 close to the RC and BChl 1 and 6 (numbering according to the original numbering of Fenna and Matthews) oriented towards the chlorosomes.

The FMO complex remains an interesting object for studies, because it is the simplest PPC appearing in nature and therefore a suitable test object for the development of methods, that can be transferred on more complex systems like photosystem I.

Differentiation-Integration for Surface Completion

In the DISC model, border ownership (the depth order at borderlines) is computed based on local occlusion cues (L- and T-junctions) and the distribution of borderlines. Two-dimensional integration is then applied to construct surfaces in the depth domain, and lightness values are in turn modified by these depth measurements. Illusory percepts emerge through the surface-construction process with the development of illusory border ownership and through the interaction between depth and lightness perception. The DISC model not only produces a central surface with the correctly modified lightness values of the original Kanizsa figure but also responds to variations of this figure such that it can distinguish between illusory and nonillusory configurations in a manner that is consistent with human perception.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000700,kinematic model,kinematic models,"Kinematics (from Greek  kinein, to move) is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects) without consideration of the forces that cause the motion.[2][3][4][1]

Kinematics is not to be confused with another branch of classical mechanics: analytical dynamics (the study of the relationship between the motion of objects and its causes), sometimes subdivided into kinetics (the study of the relation between external forces and motion) and statics (the study of the relations in a system at equilibrium). Kinematics also differs from dynamics as used in modern-day physics to describe time-evolution of a system.

The term kinematics is less common today than in the past, but still has a role in physics.[5] (See analytical dynamics for more detail on usage). The term kinematics also finds use in biomechanics and animal locomotion.[6]

The simplest application of kinematics is for particle motion, translational or rotational. The next level of complexity comes from the introduction of rigid bodies, which are collections of particles having time invariant distances between themselves. Rigid bodies might undergo translation and rotation or a combination of both. A more complicated case is the kinematics of a system of rigid bodies, which may be linked together by mechanical joints. Kinematics can be used to find the possible range of motion for a given mechanism, or, working in reverse, can be used to design a mechanism that has a desired range of motion. The movement of a crane and the oscillations of a piston in an engine are both simple kinematic systems. The crane is a type of open kinematic chain, while the piston is part of a closed four-bar linkage.

http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/NCIM/C0311420,turbidity,turbid,"Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality.

Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

Turbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5 deg from the incoming light direction.[1]

http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MSH/D057086,high intensity focused ultrasound,High-intensity focused ultrasound|HIFU,"HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound or High Frequency Ultrasound) (sometimes FUS or HIFUS) or high frequency ultrasound is a highly precise medical procedure using high-intensity focused ultrasound to heat and destroy pathogenic tissue rapidly through ablation. It is one modality of therapeutic ultrasound, and, although it induces hyperthermia, it should not be confused with this technique, which heats much less rapidly and to much lower therapeutic temperatures (in general lower than 45), although some hyperthermia treatments are ablative.

Clinical HIFU procedures are typically image-guided to permit treatment planning and targeting before applying a therapeutic or ablative level of ultrasound energy. When MRI is used for guidance, the technique is sometimes called Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound, often shortened to MRgHIFU[1]. When ultrasonography is used, the technique is sometimes called Ultrasound-guided Focused Ultrasound, often shortened to USgFUS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to identify tumors or fibroids in the body, before they are destroyed by the ultrasound. MRgFU is currently used in Australia, the United States, Canada, Israel, Europe, and Asia to treat uterine fibroids. Ultrasonography guided HIFU is currently used in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Russia, China, Romania, Mexico and Bulgaria. Current clinical trials are underway, examining the possible use of HIFU in the treatment of cancers of the brain, breast, liver, bone, and prostate.

Therapeutic ultrasound is a minimally invasive or non-invasive method to deposit acoustic energy into tissue. Applications include tissue ablation (HIFU) (for tumor treatments, for example), hyperthermia treatments (low-level heating combined with radiation or chemotherapy), or the activation or enhanced delivery of drugs.

Since integration is a vital step in retroviral replication, blocking it can halt further spread of the virus. Integrase inhibitors were initially developed for the treatment of HIV infection, but they could be applied to other retroviruses.

The first integrase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was raltegravir (brand name Isentress), approved on October 12, 2007. Research results published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 24, 2008, concluded that ""raltegravir plus optimized background therapy provided better viral suppression than optimized background therapy alone for at least 48 weeks.""[1]

Since integrase inhibitors target a distinct step in the retroviral life cycle, they may be taken in combination with other types of HIV drugs to minimize adaptation by the virus. They are also useful in salvage therapy for patients whose virus has mutated and acquired resistance to other drugs.

More generally, any equation which states that the rate of change of some quantity, at a fixed point in space, equals a positive constant times the Laplacian of that quantity.

The diffusion equation is a partial differential equation which describes density fluctuations in a material undergoing diffusion. It is also used to describe processes exhibiting diffusive-like behaviour, for instance the 'diffusion' of alleles in a population in population genetics.

The equation is usually written as:

    \frac{\partial\phi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \big[ D(\phi,\mathbf{r}) \, \nabla\phi(\mathbf{r},t) \big], 

where \, \phi(\mathbf{r},t) is the density of the diffusing material at location \mathbf{r} and time t and \, D(\phi,\mathbf{r}) is the collective diffusion coefficient for density \,\phi at location \mathbf{r}; the nabla symbol \, \nabla represents the vector differential operator del acting on the space coordinates. If the diffusion coefficient depends on the density then the equation is nonlinear, otherwise it is linear. If \, D is constant, then the equation reduces to the following linear equation:

    \frac{\partial\phi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} = D\nabla^2\phi(\mathbf{r},t), 

also called the heat equation. More generally, when D is a symmetric positive definite matrix, the equation describes anisotropic diffusion, which is written (for three dimensional diffusion) as:

    \frac{\partial\phi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^3\sum_{j=1}^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left[D_{ij}(\phi,\mathbf{r})\frac{\partial \phi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial x_j}\right]

In the simplest form, the unknown function is a real or complex valued function, but more generally, it may be vector-valued or matrix-valued: this corresponds to considering a system of ordinary differential equations for a single function. Ordinary differential equations are further classified according to the order of the highest derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable appearing in the equation. The most important cases for applications are first-order and second-order differential equations. In the classical literature also distinction is made between differential equations explicitly solved with respect to the highest derivative and differential equations in an implicit form.

The elementary principles of liquid dynamics are described by the equations of Bernoulli and Poiseuille. Bernoulli's equation deals with nonviscous liquids under steady streamline flow. Pressures in such flows are related to gravity and/or acceleration. Changes in elevation affect the gravitational potential energy of the liquid and the velocity of flow determines the kinetic energy. The sum of these three factors represented in the Bernoulli equation remains constant, but the variables are interconvertible.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000104,Gorlin equation,,"The Gorlin equation in an equation used to calculate the valve area. 
""The Gorlin equation states that the aortic valve area is equal to the flow through the aortic valve during ventricular systole divided by the systolic pressure gradient across the valve times a constant. The flow across the aortic valve is calculated by taking the cardiac output (measured in liters/minute) and dividing it by the heart rate (to give output per cardiac cycle) and then dividing it by the systolic ejection period measured in seconds per beat (to give flow per ventricular contraction).

<math>Aortic\ Valve\ Area=\frac{Cardiac\ Output}{Heart\ rate \cdot Systolic\ ejection\ period\ \cdot 44.3 \cdot \sqrt{Gradient}}<math>

The Gorlin equation is related to flow across the valve. Because of this, the valve area may be erroneously calculated as stenotic if the flow across the valve is low (ie: if the cardiac output is low). The measurement of the true gradient is accomplished by temporarily increasing the cardiac output by the infusion of positive inotropic agents, such as dobutamine. ""

The purpose of the currently accepted equations by Hemeon and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is to estimate the plume volumetric flow (Q) [The volumetric flow above a heated source is defined as the product of the plume mean velocity and area (ACGIH, 1998; Hemeon, 1999).] at which heat and fine particle effluents are being introduced to the face of the engineering control (i.e. receiving hood). Determining the plume flow is of critical interest for two reasons: (1) it must provide adequate control of the effluent to prevent spillage back into the workplace air; (2) it should be calculated as accurately as possible to prevent overventilating the process, as this wastes conditioned indoor air. Accuracy of the flow estimation is important, as results from a laboratory study to determine the accuracy of Hemeon's flow equation indicated that this equation overestimates the flow above heated sources leading to excess process ventilation (Siebert and Fraser, 1973).

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000100,Hemeon plume area equation,,"(mean velocity equation)

The purpose of the currently accepted equations by Hemeon and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is to estimate the plume volumetric flow (Q) [The volumetric flow above a heated source is defined as the product of the plume mean velocity and area (ACGIH, 1998; Hemeon, 1999).] at which heat and fine particle effluents are being introduced to the face of the engineering control (i.e. receiving hood). Determining the plume flow is of critical interest for two reasons: (1) it must provide adequate control of the effluent to prevent spillage back into the workplace air; (2) it should be calculated as accurately as possible to prevent overventilating the process, as this wastes conditioned indoor air. Accuracy of the flow estimation is important, as results from a laboratory study to determine the accuracy of Hemeon's flow equation indicated that this equation overestimates the flow above heated sources leading to excess process ventilation (Siebert and Fraser, 1973).

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000107,Kelvin equation,,"An equation giving the increase in vapor pressure of a substance which accompanies an increase in curvature of its surface; the equation describes the greater rate of evaporation of a small liquid droplet as compared to that of a larger one, and the greater solubility of small solid particles as compared to that of larger particles.
source: http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Kelvin+Equation

The Kelvin equation may be written in the form

    \ln {p \over p_0}= {2 \gamma V_m \over rRT}

where p is the actual vapour pressure, p0 is the saturated vapour pressure,  is the surface tension, Vm is the molar volume, R is the universal gas constant, r is the radius of the droplet, and T is temperature.

Equilibrium vapor pressure depends on droplet size. If p0 < p, then liquid evaporates from the droplets.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000109,Doppler equation,,"In classical physics, where the speeds of source and the receiver relative to the medium are lower than the velocity of waves in the medium, the relationship between observed frequency f and emitted frequency f0 is given by:

        f = \left( \frac{v + v_r}{v + v_{s}} \right) f_0 \,

    where

        v \; is the velocity of waves in the medium
        v_{r} \, is the velocity of the receiver relative to the medium; positive if the receiver is moving towards the source.
        v_{s} \, is the velocity of the source relative to the medium; positive if the source is moving away from the receiver.

The frequency is decreased if either is moving away from the other.

The above formula works for sound wave if and only if the speeds of the source and receiver relative to the medium are slower than the speed of sound. See also Sonic boom.

It is an interdisciplinary field that is largely concerned with the three-dimensional interpretation of planar sections of materials or tissues. It provides practical techniques for extracting quantitative information about a three-dimensional material from measurements made on two-dimensional planar sections of the material (see examples below). Stereology is a method that utilizes random, systematic sampling to provide unbiased and quantitative data. It is an important and efficient tool in many applications of microscopy (such as petrography, materials science, and biosciences including histology, bone and neuroanatomy). Stereology is a developing science with many important innovations being developed mainly in Europe. New innovations such as the proportionator continue to make important improvements in the efficiency of stereological procedures.

In addition to two-dimensional plane sections, stereology also applies to three-dimensional slabs (e.g. 3D microscope images), one-dimensional probes (e.g. needle biopsy), projected images, and other kinds of 'sampling'. It is especially useful when the sample has a lower spatial dimension than the original material. Hence, stereology is often defined as the science of estimating higher dimensional information from lower dimensional samples.

Stereology is based on fundamental principles of geometry (e.g. Cavalieri's principle) and statistics (mainly survey sampling inference). It is a completely different approach from computed tomography.

Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods; the fundamental difficulty for macroscopic thermodynamics is in defining entropy for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium[1][2].

The most widely understood approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics can (Jou, Casas-V zquez, Lebon (1993)[3]) be called classical irreversible thermodynamics. This approach demands spatial and temporal continuity of locally defined intensive variables such as temperature and internal energy density, which requires what is known as local thermodynamic equilibrium[4][5][6][7][8][9] (see also Keizer (1987)[10].

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is most successful in the study of steady states, where there are nonzero flows and entropy production, but no time variation, and of systems with dissipative structure[6].

Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods; the fundamental difficulty for macroscopic thermodynamics is in defining entropy for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium[1][2].

The most widely understood approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics can (Jou, Casas-V zquez, Lebon (1993)[3]) be called classical irreversible thermodynamics. This approach demands spatial and temporal continuity of locally defined intensive variables such as temperature and internal energy density, which requires what is known as local thermodynamic equilibrium[4][5][6][7][8][9] (see also Keizer (1987)[10]. These are very stringent demands. This present article is focused on the restricted subject of classical irreversible thermodynamics.

Other concepts of particular importance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics include time rate of dissipation of energy (Section II of Rayleigh (1873)[11]), and of time rate of entropy production (Onsager 1931)[12], and dissipative structure[6].

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000828,clearance algorithm,clearance algorithms,"algorithm for the measurement of the excretion ability of organs, especially renal excretion ability
When referring to the function of the kidney, clearance is considered to be the amount of liquid filtered out of the blood that gets processed by the kidneys or the amount of blood cleaned per time because it has the units of a volumetric flow rate [ volume / time ]. However, it does not refer to a real value; ""[t]he kidney does not completely remove a substance from the total renal plasma flow.""[1] From a mass transfer perspective[2] and physiologically, volumetric blood flow (to the dialysis machine and/or kidney) is only one of several factors that determine blood concentration and removal of a substance from the body. Other factors include the mass transfer coefficient, dialysate flow and dialysate recirculation flow for hemodialysis, and the glomerular filtration rate and the tubular reabsorption rate, for the kidney. A physiologic interpretation of clearance (at steady-state) is that clearance is a ratio of the mass generation and blood (or plasma) concentration.

Its definition follows from the differential equation that describes exponential decay and is used to model kidney function and hemodialysis machine function:

V \frac{dC}{dt} = -K \cdot C + \dot{m} \qquad (1)

Where:

    * \dot{m} is the mass generation rate of the substance - assumed to be a constant, i.e. not a function of time (equal to zero for foreign substances/drugs) [mmol/min] or [mol/s]
    * t is dialysis time or time since injection of the substance/drug [min] or [s]
    * V is the volume of distribution or total body water [L] or [m]

When referring to the function of the kidney, clearance is considered to be the amount of liquid filtered out of the blood that gets processed by the kidneys or the amount of blood cleaned per time because it has the units of a volumetric flow rate [ volume / time ]. However, it does not refer to a real value; ""[t]he kidney does not completely remove a substance from the total renal plasma flow.""[1] From a mass transfer perspective[2] and physiologically, volumetric blood flow (to the dialysis machine and/or kidney) is only one of several factors that determine blood concentration and removal of a substance from the body. Other factors include the mass transfer coefficient, dialysate flow and dialysate recirculation flow for hemodialysis, and the glomerular filtration rate and the tubular reabsorption rate, for the kidney. A physiologic interpretation of clearance (at steady-state) is that clearance is a ratio of the mass generation and blood (or plasma) concentration.

Its definition follows from the differential equation that describes exponential decay and is used to model kidney function and hemodialysis machine function:

V \frac{dC}{dt} = -K \cdot C + \dot{m} \qquad (1)

Where:

    * \dot{m} is the mass generation rate of the substance - assumed to be a constant, i.e. not a function of time (equal to zero for foreign substances/drugs) [mmol/min] or [mol/s]
    * t is dialysis time or time since injection of the substance/drug [min] or [s]
    * V is the volume of distribution or total body water [L] or [m]
    * K is the clearance [mL/min] or [m/s]
    * C is the concentration [mmol/L] or [mol/m] (in the USA often [mg/mL])

""Viscous problems are those in which fluid friction has significant effects on the fluid motion.

The Reynolds number, which is a ratio between inertial and viscous forces, can be used to evaluate whether viscous or inviscid equations are appropriate to the problem.

Stokes flow is flow at very low Reynolds numbers, Re<<1, such that inertial forces can be neglected compared to viscous forces.

On the contrary, high Reynolds numbers indicate that the inertial forces are more significant than the viscous (friction) forces. Therefore, we may assume the flow to be an inviscid flow, an approximation in which we neglect viscosity completely, compared to inertial terms.

This idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, certain problems such as those involving solid boundaries, may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity often cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition can generate a thin region of large strain rate (known as Boundary layer) which enhances the effect of even a small amount of viscosity, and thus generating vorticity. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings) we should use viscous flow equations. As illustrated by d'Alembert's paradox, a body in an inviscid fluid will experience no drag force. The standard equations of inviscid flow are the Euler equations. Another often used model, especially in computational fluid dynamics, is to use the Euler equations away from the body and the boundary layer equations, which incorporates viscosity, in a region close to the body.

The Euler equations can be integrated along a streamline to get Bernoulli's equation. When the flow is everywhere irrotational and inviscid, Bernoulli's equation can be used throughout the flow field. Such flows are called potential flows.""

http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MDR/10061986,SARS,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease in humans which is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[1] Between November 2002 and July 2003 an outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong nearly became a pandemic, with 8,422 cases and 916 deaths worldwide [2] (10.9% fatality) according to the WHO.[3] Within weeks SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect individuals in 37 countries in early 2003.[4]

As of today, the spread of SARS has been fully contained, with the last infected human case seen in June 2003 (disregarding a laboratory induced infection case in 2004). However, SARS is not claimed to have been eradicated (unlike smallpox), as it may still be present in its natural host reservoirs (animal populations) and may potentially return into the human population in the future.

The fatality of SARS is less than 1% for people aged 24 or younger, 6% for those 25 to 44, 15% for those 45 to 64, and more than 50% for those over 65.[5] For comparison, the fatality of influenza is usually around 0.6% (primarily among the elderly) but can rise as high as 33% in severe epidemics of new strains.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000684,exponential model,exponential models,"Exponential model is associated with the name of Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834) who first realized that any species can potentially increase in numbers according to a geometric series. For example, if a species has non-overlapping populations (e.g., annual plants), and each organism produces R offspring, then, population numbers N in generations t=0,1,2,... is equal to:
N_1 = N_0 * R
N_t = N_1 * R^t

When t is large, then this equation can be approximated by an exponential function:

For example, if a species has non-overlapping populations (e.g., annual plants), and each organism produces R offspring, then, population numbers N in generations t=0,1,2,... is equal to:
N_1 = N_0 * R
N_t = N_1 * R^t

These random effects are usually assumed to have a normal distribution.

Fitting such models by maximum likelihood involves integrating over these random effects. In general, these integrals cannot be expressed in analytical form. Various approximate methods have been developed, but none has good properties for all possible models and data sets (ungrouped binary data being particularly problematic).

These minimization problems arise especially in least squares curve fitting and nonlinear programming.

The LMA interpolates between the Gauss Newton algorithm (GNA) and the method of gradient descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means that in many cases it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. On the other hand, for well-behaved functions and reasonable starting parameters, the LMA tends to be a bit slower than the GNA. LMA can also be viewed as Gauss Newton using a trust region approach.

It thus enables the direct viewing of columns of atoms in a crystalline material.""

This requires a good source of random numbers . There is always some error involved with this scheme, but the larger the number of random samples taken, the more accurate the result.

In its pure mathematical form, the Monte Carlo method consists of finding the definite integral of a function by choosing a large number of independent-variable samples at random from within an interval or region, averaging the resulting dependent-variable values, and then dividing by the span of the interval or the size of the region over which the random samples were chosen. This differs from the classical method of approximating a definite integral, in which independent-variable samples are selected at equally-spaced points within an interval or region.

This electric field exerts a force on other electrically charged objects. Michael Faraday introduced the concept of an electric field.

The electric field is a vector field with SI units of newtons per coulomb (N C-1) or, equivalently, volts per metre (V m-1). The SI base units of the electric field are kg

An electric field that changes with time, such as due to the motion of charged particles in the field, influences the local magnetic field. That is, the electric and magnetic fields are not completely separate phenomena; what one observer perceives as an electric field, another observer in a different frame of reference perceives as a mixture of electric and magnetic fields. For this reason, one speaks of ""electromagnetism"" or ""electromagnetic fields"". In quantum mechanics, disturbances in the electromagnetic fields are called photons, and the energy of photons is quantized.

The electric field is a vector field with SI units of newtons per coulomb (N C-1) or, equivalently, volts per metre (V m-1). The SI base units of the electric field are kg

An electric field that changes with time, such as due to the motion of charged particles in the field, influences the local magnetic field. That is, the electric and magnetic fields are not completely separate phenomena; what one observer perceives as an electric field, another observer in a different frame of reference perceives as a mixture of electric and magnetic fields. For this reason, one speaks of ""electromagnetism"" or ""electromagnetic fields"". In quantum mechanics, disturbances in the electromagnetic fields are called photons, and the energy of photons is quantized.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00001433,_Polarimetric imaging,,"Polarimetry is the measurement and interpretation of the polarization of transverse waves, most notably electromagnetic waves, such as radio or light waves. Typically polarimetry is done on electromagnetic waves that have traveled through or have been reflected, refracted, or diffracted by some material in order to characterize that object.

A polarimeter is the basic scientific instrument used to make these measurements, although this term is rarely used to describe a polarimetry process performed by a computer, such as is done in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar.

Polarimetry of thin films and surfaces is commonly known as ellipsometry.

Polarimetry can be used to measure various optical properties of a material, including linear birefringence, circular birefringence (also known as optical rotation or optical rotary dispersion), linear dichroism, circular dichroism and scattering.

To measure these various properties, there have been many designs of polarimeters. Some are archaic and some are in current use. The most sensitive polarimeters are based on interferometers, while more conventional polarimeters are based on arrangements of polarising filters, wave plates or other devices.

Polarimetry can also be included in computational analysis of waves. For example, radars often consider wave polarization in post-processing to improve the characterization of the targets. In this case, polarimetry can be used to estimate the fine texture of a material, help resolve the orientation of small structures in the target, and, when circularly-polarized antennas are used, resolve the number of bounces of the received signal (the chirality of circularly polarized waves alternates with each reflection).

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000113,Navier-Stokes equation,Navier-Stokes equations,"In physics the Navier Stokes equations, named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes, describe the motion of fluid substances. These equations arise from applying Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity), plus a pressure term.
...
The derivation of the Navier Stokes equations begins with an application of Newton's second law: conservation of momentum (often alongside mass and energy conservation) being written for an arbitrary portion of the fluid. In an inertial frame of reference, the general form of the equations of fluid motion is:[2]

    \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\mathbb{T} + \mathbf{f},

where \mathbf{v} is the flow velocity,  is the fluid density, p is the pressure, \mathbb{T} is the (deviatoric) stress tensor, and \mathbf{f} represents body forces (per unit volume) acting on the fluid and \nabla is the del operator. This is a statement of the conservation of momentum in a fluid and it is an application of Newton's second law to a continuum; in fact this equation is applicable to any non-relativistic continuum and is known as the Cauchy momentum equation.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000114,nonlinear differential equation,,"A system of differential equations is said to be nonlinear if it is not a linear system. Problems involving nonlinear differential equations are extremely diverse, and methods of solution or analysis are problem dependent. Examples of nonlinear differential equations are the Navier Scholes PDE in finance.

One of the greatest difficulties of nonlinear problems is that it is not generally possible to combine known solutions into new solutions. In linear problems, for example, a family of linearly independent solutions can be used to construct general solutions through the superposition principle. A good example of this is one-dimensional heat transport with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solution of which can be written as a time-dependent linear combination of sinusoids of differing frequencies; this makes solutions very flexible. It is often possible to find several very specific solutions to nonlinear equations, however the lack of a superposition principle prevents the construction of new solutions.

Insulin stops the use of fat as an energy source by inhibiting the release of glucagon. With the exception of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus and Metabolic syndrome, insulin is provided within the body in a constant proportion to remove excess glucose from the blood, which otherwise would be toxic. When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis, which breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose, which can then be utilized as an energy source. As its level is a central metabolic control mechanism, its status is also used as a control signal to other body systems (such as amino acid uptake by body cells). In addition, it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body.

More precisely, the divergence theorem states that the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence on the region inside the surface. Intuitively, it states that the sum of all sources minus the sum of all sinks gives the net flow out of a region.

The divergence theorem is an important result for the mathematics of engineering, in particular in electrostatics and fluid dynamics.

The theorem is a special case of the more general Stokes' theorem, which generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus.[1]

    \iiint\limits_V\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}\right)dV=\iint\limits_{S}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\subset\!\supset (\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n}\,)dS .

Central to any Eulerian method is the manner in which it discretizes the continuous domain of interest into a grid of many individual elements. This grid may be static, established once and for all at the beginning of the computation, or it may be dynamic, tracking the features of the result as the computation progresses. If the computation has features which one wants to track which are much smaller than the overall scale of the problem, and which move in time, then one must either include many more static grids to cover the region of interest, or adopt a dynamic scheme.

Other arthritis forms are rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and related autoimmune diseases. Septic arthritis is caused by joint infection.

The major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is joint pain. Pain is often a constant and may be localized to the joint affected. The pain from arthritis occurs due to inflammation that occurs around the joint, damage to the joint from disease, daily wear and tear of joint, muscle strains caused by forceful movements against stiff, painful joints and fatigue.

Christian Doppler was the first to describe the frequency shift that occurs when sound or light is emitted from a moving source and the effect now bears his name. For the velocity measurement of blood, ultrasound is transmitted into a vessel and the sound that is reflected from the blood is detected. Because the blood is moving, the sound undergoes a frequency (Doppler) shift that is described by the Doppler equation:

F = Fo   (c + v   cos(q))/ (c - v   cos(q))

where:

c is the acoustic velocity in blood, i.e., 1.54 
F o is the transmitted frequency;
q is the Doppler angle;
v is the velocity of the blood.
...
There are three main techniques for making Doppler ultrasound velocity measurements of blood flow; continuous wave Doppler, pulsed Doppler, and color Doppler. Pulsed Doppler can be referred to as pulsed Doppler, spectral Doppler, or duplex Doppler.

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000010,second,seconds,"The second (SI symbol: s), sometimes abbreviated sec., is a unit of time, and is the International System of Units (SI) base unit of time.[1] It may be measured using a clock.

Early definitions of the second were based on the apparent motion of the sun around the earth.[2] The solar day was divided into 24 hours, each of which contained 60 minutes of 60 seconds each, so the second was 1/86?400 of the mean solar day. However, 19th- and 20th century astronomical observations revealed that this average time is lengthening, and thus the sun/earth motion is no longer considered a suitable basis for definition. With the advent of atomic clocks, it became feasible to define the second based on fundamental properties of nature. Since 1967, the second has been defined to be

    the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.[1]

SI prefixes are frequently combined with the word second to denote subdivisions of the second, e.g., the millisecond (one thousandth of a second), the microsecond (one millionth of a second), and the nanosecond (one billionth of a second). Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second such as kilosecond (one thousand seconds), such units are rarely used in practice. The more common larger non-SI units of time are not formed by powers of ten; instead, the second is multiplied by 60 to form a minute, which is multiplied by 60 to form an hour, which is multiplied by 24 to form a day.

The most comprehensive description of scattering from crystals is given by the dynamical theory of diffraction.[1]

    * Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is a technique used to solve the complete structure of crystalline materials, ranging from simple inorganic solids to complex macromolecules, such as proteins.
    * Powder diffraction (XRD) is a technique used to characterise the crystallographic structure, crystallite size (grain size), and preferred orientation in polycrystalline or powdered solid samples. Powder diffraction is commonly used to identify unknown substances, by comparing diffraction data against a database maintained by the International Centre for Diffraction Data. It may also be used to characterize heterogeneous solid mixtures to determine relative abundance of crystalline compounds and, when coupled with lattice refinement techniques, such as Rietveld refinement, can provide structural information on unknown materials. Powder diffraction is also a common method for determining strains in crystalline materials. An effect of the finite crystallite sizes is seen as a broadening of the peaks in an X-ray diffraction as is explained by the Scherrer Equation.
    * Thin film diffraction and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction may be used to characterize the crystallographic structure and preferred orientation of substrate-anchored thin films.
    * High-resolution X-ray diffraction is used to characterize thickness, crystallographic structure, and strain in thin epitaxial films. It employs parallel-beam optics.
    * X-ray pole figure analysis enables one to analyze and determine the distribution of crystalline orientations within a crystalline thin-film sample.
    * X-ray rocking curve analysis is used to quantify grain size and mosaic spread in crystalline materials.

In its simplest form, LDV crosses two beams of collimated, monochromatic, and coherent laser light in the flow of the fluid being measured. The two beams are usually obtained by splitting a single beam, thus ensuring coherency between the two. The two beams are made to intersect at their waists (the focal point of a laser beam), where they interfere and generate a set of straight fringes. The sensor is then aligned to the flow such that the fringes are perpendicular to the flow direction. As particles pass through the fringes, they reflect light (only from the regions of constructive interference) into a photodetector (typically an avalanche photodiode).

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00001507,Forster Resonance Energy Transfer,Foerster resonance energy transfer|resonance energy transfer|electronic energy transfer|fluorescence resonance energy transfer|EET|FRET|RET,"Foerster resonance energy transfer (abbreviated FRET), also known as fluorescence resonance energy transfer, resonance energy transfer (RET) or electronic energy transfer (EET), is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two chromophores.

A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore (in proximity, typically less than 10 nm) through nonradiative dipole dipole coupling. This mechanism is termed ""Foerster resonance energy transfer"" and is named after the German scientist Theodor Foerster.[2] When both chromophores are fluorescent, the term ""fluorescence resonance energy transfer"" is often used instead, although the energy is not actually transferred by fluorescence.[3],[4] In order to avoid an erroneous interpretation of the phenomenon that is always a nonradiative transfer of energy (even when occurring between two fluorescent chromophores), the name ""Foerster resonance energy transfer"" is preferred to ""fluorescence resonance energy transfer;"" however, the latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature. FRET is analogous to near field communication, in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the wavelength of light emitted. In the near field region, the excited chromophore emits a virtual photon that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a radiationless mechanism. Quantum electrodynamical calculations have been used to determine that radiationless (FRET) and radiative energy transfer are the short- and long-range asymptotes of a single unified mechanism.

The time dependence of the statistical distribution in space is given by the diffusion equation. The concept of diffusion is tied to that of mass transfer driven by a concentration gradient, but diffusion can still occur when there is no concentration gradient (but there will be no net flux).

The concept of diffusion emerged from physical sciences. The paradigmatic examples were heat diffusion, molecular diffusion and Brownian motion. Their mathematical descriptions were elaborated by Joseph Fourier in 1822, Adolf Fick in 1855, and by Albert Einstein and Marian Smoluchowski in 1905/06, respectively.

It has several subdisciplines itself, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and reportedly modeling fission weapon detonation. Some of its principles are even used in traffic engineering, where traffic is treated as a continuous fluid.

Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure that underlies these practical disciplines, that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves calculating various properties of the fluid, such as velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of space and time.

This property is caused by cohesion of like molecules, and is responsible for many of the behaviors of liquids.

Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent but when referring to energy per unit of area, people use the term surface energy which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids.

(Technically the former is an etalon and the latter is an interferometer, but the terminology is often used inconsistently.) Its transmission spectrum as a function of wavelength exhibits peaks of large transmission corresponding to resonances of the etalon. It is named after Charles Fabry and Alfred Perot.[1] ""Etalon"" is from the French  talon, meaning ""measuring gauge"" or ""standard"".[2]

The resonance effect of the Fabry rot interferometer is identical to that used in a dichroic filter. That is, dichroic filters are very thin sequential arrays of Fabry rot interferometers, and are therefore characterised and designed using the same mathematics.

Etalons are widely used in telecommunications, lasers and spectroscopy to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Recent advances in fabrication technique allow the creation of very precise tunable Fabry rot interferometers.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00001319,_laryngeal mask airway,LMA,"Laryngeal masks consist of a tube with an inflatable cuff that is inserted into the pharynx. Laryngeal mask airways come in a variety of sizes ranging from large adult (size 5) to infant (size 1). The laryngeal mask functions as a ""peripharyngeal sealer,"" in contrast to another category of supraglottic airways which are ""base on tongue sealers,"" such as the Esophageal-Tracheal Combitube and the King Laryngeal tube (LT). A newer generation of the laryngeal mask actually utilizes both airway sealing mechanisms (peripharyngeal sealing and base of tongue sealing), and they result in higher average seal pressures during controlled and assisted ventilation of the patient. The apex of the mask, with its open end pointing downwards toward the tongue, is pushed backwards towards the uvula. The cuff follows the natural bend of the oropharynx, and is seated over the pyriform fossae. Once placed, the cuff around the mask is inflated with air to create a tight seal. Air entry is confirmed by listening for air entry into the lungs with a stethoscope, by presence of end tidal carbon dioxide and by monitoring the degree and pressure at which the air leaks around the mask in the oropharynx.

The most active area of interest in the folding of molecules is the process of protein folding, which is the shape that is assumed by a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein. The shape of the folded protein can be used to understand its function and design drugs to influence the processes that it is involved in.

They are called bisphosphonates because they have two phosphonate (PO3) groups and are similar in structure to pyrophosphate.

Evidence shows that they reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture in those who have had previous fractures however do not reduce fracture risk in those with osteoporosis who have not previously had a fracture.[1][2]

Bone undergoes constant turnover and is kept in balance (homeostasis) by osteoblasts creating bone and osteoclasts destroying bone. Bisphosphonates inhibit the digestion of bone by encouraging osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis, or cell death, thereby slowing bone loss.[3]

The uses of bisphosphonates include the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, osteitis deformans (""Paget's disease of bone""), bone metastasis (with or without hypercalcaemia), multiple myeloma, primary hyperparathyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, and other conditions that feature bone fragility.

http://purl.org/obo/owlapi/kisao#KISAO_0000093,Livermore solver for ordinary differential equations for stiff and nonstiff systems with krylov corrector iteration,LSODPK,"""LSODPK, written jointly with Peter N Brown, is a set of FORTRAN subroutines for solving the initial value problem for stiff and nonstiff systems of ordinary differential equations. In solving stiff systems, LSODPK uses a corrector iteration composed of Newton iteration and one of four preconditoned Krylov subspace iteration methods. The user must select the desired Krylov method and supply a pair of routine to evaluate, preprocess, and solve the (left and/or right) preconditioner matrices. Aside from preconditioning, the implementation is matrix-free, meaning that explicit storage of the Jacobian (or related) matrix is not required. The method is experimental because the scope of problems for which it is effective is not well-known, and users are forewarned that LSODPK may or may not be competitive with traditional methods on a given problem. LSODPK also includes an option for a user-supplied linear system solver to be used without Krylov iteration [http://www.nea.fr/abs/html/uscd1231.html].""

For instance, in a pharmacokinetic model, the compartments may represent different sections of a body within which the concentration of a drug is assumed to be uniformly equal. Hence a multi-compartment model is a lumped parameters model. ... In systems theory, it involves the description of a network whose components are compartments that represent a population of elements that are equivalent with respect to the manner in which they process input signals to the compartment.

It was introduced in the field of Operations research by Jay Forrester as a methodology that became known as System Dynamics. ... 

Generally speaking, as the number of compartments increase, it is challenging both to find the algebraic and numerical solutions of the model. However, there are special cases of models, which rarely exist in nature, when the topologies exhibit certain regularities that the solutions become easier to find. The model can be classified according to the interconnection of cells and input/output characteristics:

   1. Closed model: No sinks or source, lit. all koi = 0 and ui = 0;
   2. Open model: There are sinks or/and sources among cells.
   3. Catenary model: All compartments are arranged in a chain, with each pool connecting only to its neighbors. This model has two or more cells.
   4. Cyclic model: It's a special case of the catenary model, with three or more cells, in which the first and last cell are connected, i.e. k1n 
   5. Mammillary model: Consists of a central compartment with peripheral compartments connecting to it. There are no interconnections among other compartments.
   6. Reducible model: It's a set of unconnected models. It bears great resemblance to the computer concept of forest as against trees.

There are many different models, each with its own type of analysis:

   1. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) methods extend analysis of variance methods to cover cases where there is more than one dependent variable to be analyzed simultaneously: see also MANCOVA.
   2. Multivariate regression analysis attempts to determine a formula that can describe how elements in a vector of variables respond simultaneously to changes in others. For linear relations, regression analyses here are based on forms of the general linear model.
   3. Principal components analysis (PCA) finds a set of synthetic variables that summarise the original set. It rotates the axes of variation to give a new set of ordered orthogonal axes that summarize decreasing proportions of the variation.
   4. Factor analysis is similar to PCA but attempts to determine a smaller set of synthetic variables that could explain the original set.
   5. Canonical correlation analysis finds linear relationships among two sets of variables; it is the generalised (i.e. canonical) version of correlation.
   6. Redundancy analysis is similar to canonical correlation analysis but deriving a minimal set of synthetic variables from one set of (independent) variables that explains as much variance as possible in the other (dependent) set. It is a multivariate analogue of regression.
   7. Correspondence analysis (CA), or reciprocal averaging, finds (like PCA) a set of synthetic variables that summarise the original set. The underlying model assumes chi-squared dissimilarities among records (cases). There is also canonical correspondance analysis (CCA) for summarising the joint variation in two sets of variables.
   8. Multidimensional scaling covers various algorithms to determine a set of synthetic variables that best represent the pairwise distances between records. The original method is principal coordinates analysis (based on PCA).
   9. Discriminant function or canonical variate analysis attempts to establish whether a set of variables can be used to distinguish between two or more groups.
  10. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) computes a linear predictor from two sets of normally distributed data to allow for classification of new observations.
  11. Clustering systems assign objects into groups (called clusters) so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different clusters.
  12. Recursive partitioning creates a decision tree that strives to correctly classify members of the population based on a dichotomous dependent variable

Each pause in breathing, called an apnea, can last from a few seconds to minutes, and may occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour.[1] Similarly, each abnormally low breathing event is called a hypopnea. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or ""sleep study"".

There are three forms of sleep apnea: central (CSA), obstructive (OSA), and complex or mixed sleep apnea (i.e., a combination of central and obstructive) constituting 0.4%, 84% and 15% of cases respectively.[2] In CSA, breathing is interrupted by a lack of respiratory effort; in OSA, breathing is interrupted by a physical block to airflow despite respiratory effort, and snoring is common.

    * Inertial mass,
    * active gravitational mass and
    * passive gravitational mass.

Although mass must be distinguished from matter in physics, because matter is a poorly-defined concept, and although all types of agreed-upon matter exhibit mass, it is also the case that many types of energy which are not matter  such as potential energy, kinetic energy, and trapped electromagnetic radiation (photons) also exhibit mass. Thus, all matter has the property of mass, but not all mass is associated with identifiable matter.

In everyday usage, mass is often used interchangeably with weight, and the units of weight are often taken to be kilograms (for instance, a person may state that his weight is 75 kg). In proper scientific use, however, the two terms refer to different, yet related, properties of matter.

The inertial mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force. According to Newton's second law of motion, if a body of fixed mass m is subjected to a force F, its acceleration a is given by F/m.

A body's mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational field. If a first body of mass m1 is placed at a distance r from a second body of mass m2, each body experiences an attractive force F whose magnitude is

    F = G\,\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \, ,

where G is the universal constant of gravitation, equal to 6.6711

Both definitions imply that weight is a force and that its value depends on the local gravitational field. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram will have a weight of 9.8N on the surface of the Earth, about six times less on the Moon, and zero when floating freely far out in space away from all gravitational influence. The differences between the two definitions are discussed below. For example, they differ over the weight of an object in free fall, such as a falling apple or an astronaut in an orbiting spacecraft. In these cases, the operational definition implies the weight is zero, whereas the gravitational definition does not.

An object's gravitational weight W numerically (i.e. as a purely scalar quantity) is the product of the mass m of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration g:[2] Thus: W = m g.

In short, the Arrhenius equation gives ""the dependence of the rate constant k of chemical reactions on the temperature T (in absolute temperature, such as kelvins or degrees Rankine) and activation energy[3] Ea"", as shown below:[1]

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000130,Michaelis-Menten equation,,"the Michaelis Menten equation describes the rates of irreversible enzymatic reactions by relating reaction rate to the concentration of the substrate.
...
The validity of the following derivation rests on the reaction scheme given below and two key assumptions: that the total enzyme concentration and the concentration of the intermediate complex do not change over time. The most convenient derivation of the Michaelis Menten equation, described by Briggs and Haldane, is obtained as follows (Note that often the experimental parameter kcat is used but in this simple case it is equal to the kinetic parameter k2):

The enzymatic reaction is assumed to be irreversible, and the product does not bind to the enzyme.

    E + S \overset{k_1}\underset{k_{-1}}{\begin{smallmatrix}\displaystyle\longrightarrow \\ \displaystyle\longleftarrow \end{smallmatrix}} ES \overset{k_2} {\longrightarrow} E + P \qquad \qquad (1) 

The first key assumption in this derivation is the quasi-steady-state assumption (or pseudo-steady-state hypothesis), namely that the concentration of the substrate-bound enzyme ([ES]) changes much more slowly than those of the product ([P]) and substrate ([S]).

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000133,QSAR equation,,"Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) (sometimes QSPR: quantitative structure-property relationship) is the process by which chemical structure is quantitatively correlated with a well defined process, such as biological activity or chemical reactivity.

For example, biological activity can be expressed quantitatively as in the concentration of a substance required to give a certain biological response. Additionally, when physicochemical properties or structures are expressed by numbers, one can form a mathematical relationship, or quantitative structure-activity relationship, between the two. The mathematical expression can then be used to predict the biological response of other chemical structures.

QSAR's most general mathematical form is:

    * \;\text{Activity} = f(\text{physiochemical properties and/or structural properties})

Hilliard) is an equation of mathematical physics which describes the process of phase separation, by which the two components of a binary fluid spontaneously separate and form domains pure in each component. If c is the concentration of the fluid, with c=\pm1 indicating domains, then the equation is written as

    \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D\nabla^2\left(c^3-c-\gamma\nabla^2 c\right),

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00001187,Liouville equation,Liouville's equation,"In differential geometry, Liouville's equation, named after Joseph Liouville, is the nonlinear ordinary differential equation satisfied by the conformal factor f of a metric f2(dx2 + dy2) on a surface of constant Gaussian curvature K:

where ?0 is the flat Laplace operator.

    \Delta_0 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} +\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} = 4 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z}

Liouville's equation typically appears in differential geometry books under the heading isothermal coordinates. This term refers to the coordinates x,y, while f can be described as the conformal factor with respect to the flat metric (sometimes the square f2 is referred to as the conformal factor, instead of f itself).

The theory was developed in 1925 by Werner Heisenberg.[1] Quantum mechanics describes the time evolution of physical systems via a mathematical structure called the wave function. The wave function encapsulates the probability that the system is to be found in a given state at a given time. Quantum mechanics also allows one to calculate the effect on the system of making measurements of properties of the system by defining the effect of those measurements on the wave function. This leads to the well-known uncertainty principle as well as the enduring debate over the role of the experimenter, epitomised in the Schr  dinger's Cat thought experiment.

When x-rays are incident on an atom, they make the electronic cloud move as does any electromagnetic wave. The movement of these charges re-radiates waves with the same frequency (blurred slightly due to a variety of effects); this phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering (or elastic scattering). The scattered waves can themselves be scattered but this secondary scattering is assumed to be negligible. A similar process occurs upon scattering neutron waves from the nuclei or by a coherent spin interaction with an unpaired electron. These re-emitted wave fields interfere with each other either constructively or destructively (overlapping waves either add together to produce stronger peaks or subtract from each other to some degree), producing a diffraction pattern on a detector or film. The resulting wave interference pattern is the basis of diffraction analysis. Both neutron and X-ray wavelengths are comparable with inter-atomic distances (~150 pm) and thus are an excellent probe for this length scale.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000910,T_A mass balance equation,,"Balance equation for mass.
""In general, the calculations are rather complicated. For instance, in the case of a dibasic acid, H2A dissolved in water the two reactants can be specified as the conjugate base, A2-, and the proton, H+. The following equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as 1,2-diaminoethane, in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:

    T_A = [A] + [HA] +[H_2A] \,
    T_H = [H] + [HA] + 2[H_2A] - [OH] \,

With TA the total concentration of species A. Note that it is customary to omit the ionic charges when writing and using these equations.

When the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are specified there are two equations in two unknown ""free concentrations"" [A] and [H]. This follows from the fact that [HA]= 1

    T_A = [A] + \beta_1[A][H] + \beta_2[A][H]^2 \,
    T_H = [H] + \beta_1[A][H] + 2\beta_2[A][H]^2 - K_w[H]^{-1} \,

so the concentrations of the ""complexes"" are calculated from the free concentrations and the equilibrium constants. General expressions applicable to all systems with two reagents, A and B would be

    T_A=[A]+\sum_i{p_i \beta_i[A]^{p_i}[B]^{q_i}}
    T_B=[B]+\sum_i{q_i \beta_i[A]^{p_i}[B]^{q_i}}

It is easy to see how this can be extended to three or more reagents.""

""In general, the calculations are rather complicated. For instance, in the case of a dibasic acid, H2A dissolved in water the two reactants can be specified as the conjugate base, A2-, and the proton, H+. The following equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as 1,2-diaminoethane, in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:

    T_A = [A] + [HA] +[H_2A] \,
    T_H = [H] + [HA] + 2[H_2A] - [OH] \,

With TA the total concentration of species A. Note that it is customary to omit the ionic charges when writing and using these equations.

When the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are specified there are two equations in two unknown ""free concentrations"" [A] and [H]. This follows from the fact that [HA]= 1

    T_A = [A] + \beta_1[A][H] + \beta_2[A][H]^2 \,
    T_H = [H] + \beta_1[A][H] + 2\beta_2[A][H]^2 - K_w[H]^{-1} \,

so the concentrations of the ""complexes"" are calculated from the free concentrations and the equilibrium constants. General expressions applicable to all systems with two reagents, A and B would be

    T_A=[A]+\sum_i{p_i \beta_i[A]^{p_i}[B]^{q_i}}
    T_B=[B]+\sum_i{q_i \beta_i[A]^{p_i}[B]^{q_i}}

It is easy to see how this can be extended to three or more reagents.""

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_52210,pharmacological role,pharmacological|pharmacology,"Pharmacology (from Greek , pharmakon, ""poison in classic Greek; drug in modern Greek""; and , ""Study of"" -logia) is the branch of medicine and biology concerned with the study of drug action.[1] More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals. The field encompasses drug composition and properties, interactions, toxicology, therapy, and medical applications and antipathogenic capabilities. The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The former studies the effects of the drugs on biological systems, and the latter the effects of biological systems on the drugs. In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the interactions of chemicals with biological receptors, and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals from the biological systems. Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused. Pharmacology deals with how drugs interact within biological systems to affect function. It is the study of drugs, of the reactions of the body and drug on each other, the sources of drugs, their nature, and their properties. In contrast, pharmacy is a biomedical science concerned with preparation, dispensing, dosage, and the safe and effective use of medicines.[citation needed]

Methods of velocimetry include particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry, Molecular tagging velocimetry, laser-based interferometry, ultrasonic Doppler methods, Doppler sensors, and new signal processing methodologies. Temporal integration of velocimetric information can be used to totalize fluid flow.

In general, velocity measurements are made in the Lagrangian or Eulerian frames of reference (see Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates). Lagrangian methods assign a velocity to a volume of fluid at a given time, whereas Eulerian methods assign a velocity to a volume of the measurement domain at a given time. A classic example of the distinction is particle tracking velocimetry, where the idea is to find the velocity of individual flow tracer particles (Lagrangian) and particle image velocimetry, where the objective is to find the average velocity within a sub-region of the field of view (Eulerian).

By pacing both sides of the left ventricle, the pacemaker can resynchronize a heart whose opposing walls do not contract in synchrony, which occurs in approximately 25-50 % of heart failure patients. CRT devices have at least two leads, one in the right ventricle to stimulate the septum, and another inserted through the coronary sinus to pace the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Often, for patients in normal sinus rhythm, there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate synchrony with the atrial contraction. Thus, timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions, as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function. CRT devices have been shown to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with heart failure symptoms; a LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and QRS duration on EKG of 120 msec or greater.[21][22][23] CRT can be combined with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).[24]

Systole (pronounced /'s?st?li?/) is a phase of contraction during the cardiac cycle. Used alone, the term usually describes the phase of left ventricle contraction.[1] During systole, the myocardium contracts in a coordinated manner in response to a complex endogenous autonomic physiologic electrical stimulus. Systole results in positive fluid pressure generated within the chambers of the heart, driving blood flow out of the heart and into the body and lungs. Experimental and clinical volumetric measurements of systolic contraction are often based on ejection fraction (or EF) and cardiac output (or CO).

Systole (pronounced /'s?st?li?/) is a phase of contraction during the cardiac cycle. Used alone, the term usually describes the phase of left ventricle contraction.[1] During systole, the myocardium contracts in a coordinated manner in response to a complex endogenous autonomic physiologic electrical stimulus. Systole results in positive fluid pressure generated within the chambers of the heart, driving blood flow out of the heart and into the body and lungs. Experimental and clinical volumetric measurements of systolic contraction are often based on ejection fraction (or EF) and cardiac output (or CO). All four chambers of a mammalian heart undergo systole in a time-phased fashion, allowing forward propulsion of blood through and out of the heart.

An autoradiograph is an image on an x-ray film or nuclear emulsion produced by the pattern of decay emissions (e.g., beta particles or gamma rays) from a distribution of a radioactive substance. Alternatively, the autoradiograph is also available as a digital image (digital autoradiography), due to the recent development of scintillation gas detectors[1] or rare earth phosphorimaging systems[2]. In biology, this technique may be used to determine the tissue localization of a radioactive substance, either introduced into a metabolic pathway, bound to a receptor[3][4] or enzyme, or hybridized to a nucleic acid[5]. The film or emulsion is apposed to the labeled tissue section to obtain the autoradiograph (also called an autoradiogram). The auto- prefix indicates that the radioactive substance is within the sample, as distinguished from the case of historadiography or microradiography, in which the sample is X-rayed using an external source.

It was proved in 1925 that every surface has a triangulation, but it might require an infinite number of triangles and the proof is difficult (Francis and Weeks 1999). A surface with a finite number of triangles in its triangulation is called compact.

Wickham-Jones (1994) gives an O(n^3) algorithm for triangulation (""otectomy""), and O'Rourke (1998, p. 47) sketches a method for improving this to O(n^2), as first done by Lennes (1911). Garey et al. (1978) gave an algorithmically straightforward O(nlnn) method for triangulation, which was for many years believed optimal. However, Tarjan and van Wyk (1988) produced an O(nlglgn) algorithm.

Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in humans, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls.[2][3] The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2,[4] and by preventing the establishment of pathogenic bacteria within the intestine.[5][6]

E. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0.1% of gut flora,[7] and fecal-oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination.[8][9] The bacterium can also be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism,[citation needed] and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA.

Symptoms may include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, locking, and sometimes an effusion. A variety of causes hereditary, developmental, metabolic, and mechanical may initiate processes leading to loss of cartilage. When bone surfaces become less well protected by cartilage, bone may be exposed and damaged. As a result of decreased movement secondary to pain, regional muscles may atrophy, and ligaments may become more lax.[2]

Treatment generally involves a combination of exercise, lifestyle modification, and analgesics. If pain becomes debilitating, joint replacement surgery may be used to improve the quality of life. OA is the most common form of arthritis,[2] and the leading cause of chronic disability in the United States.[3] It affects about 8 million people in the United Kingdom and nearly 27 million people in the United States.

The definition of myocarditis varies, but the central feature is an infection of the heart, with an inflammatory infiltrate, and damage to the heart muscle, without the blockage of coronary arteries that define a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or other common noninfectious causes.[2] Myocarditis may or may not include death (necrosis) of heart tissue.

Although this limit varies from person to person, it is approximately 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in healthy, young adults and thus, 20 kHz serves as a useful lower limit in describing ultrasound. The production of ultrasound is used in many different fields, typically to penetrate a medium and measure the reflection signature or supply focused energy. The reflection signature can reveal details about the inner structure of the medium, a property also used by animals such as bats for hunting.

Cells use it as the primary source of energy[1] and a metabolic intermediate. Glucose is one of the main products of photosynthesis and starts cellular respiration.

Glucose exists in several different structures, but all of these structures can be divided into two families of mirror-images (stereoisomers). Only one set of these isomers exists in nature, those derived from the ""right-handed form"" of glucose, denoted D-glucose. D-glucose is often referred to as dextrose. The term dextrose is derived from dextrorotatory glucose.[2] Solutions of dextrose rotate polarized light to the right. Starch and cellulose are polymers derived from the dehydration of D-glucose. The other stereoisomer, called L-glucose, is hardly found in nature.

The name ""glucose"" comes from the Greek word glukus, meaning ""sweet"". The suffix ""-ose"" denotes a sugar. The name ""dextrose"" and the 'D-' prefix come from Latin dexter (""right""), referring to the handedness of the molecules.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00001400,Parallel tempering,replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)|PT|REMD,"Parallel tempering, also known as replica exchange MCMC sampling, is a simulation method aimed at improving the dynamic properties of Monte Carlo method simulations of physical systems, and of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods more generally. The replica exchange method was originated by Swendsen,[1] then extended by Geyer[2] and later developed, among others, by Giorgio Parisi.[3][4] Sugita and Okamoto formulated a molecular dynamics version of parallel tempering [5]: this is usually known as replica-exchange molecular dynamics or REMD.

Essentially, one runs N copies of the system, randomly initialized, at different temperatures. Then, based on the Metropolis criterion one exchanges configurations at different temperatures. The idea of this method is to make configurations at high temperatures available to the simulations at low temperatures and vice versa. This results in a very robust ensemble which is able to sample both low and high energy configurations. In this way, thermodynamical properties such as the specific heat, which is in general not well computed in the canonical ensemble, can be computed with great precision.

In most animals the nervous system consists of two parts, central and peripheral. The central nervous system of vertebrates (such as humans) contains the brain, spinal cord, and retina. The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, clusters of neurons called ganglia, and nerves connecting them to each other and to the central nervous system. These regions are all interconnected by means of complex neural pathways. The enteric nervous system, a subsystem of the peripheral nervous system, has the capacity, even when severed from the rest of the nervous system through its primary connection by the vagus nerve, to function independently in controlling the gastrointestinal system.

""In physics, energy (Ancient Greek:   energeia ""activity, operation""[1]) is a quantity that is often understood as the ability a physical system has to produce changes on another physical system.[2][3]

The changes are produced when the energy is transferred from a system to another. A system can transfer energy by means of three ways, namely: physical or thermodynamical work, heat transfer, or mass transfer.""

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000749,Maxwell model,Maxwell models,"The Maxwell model can be represented by a purely viscous damper and a purely elastic spring connected in series, as shown in the diagram. The model can be represented by the following equation:

    \frac {d\epsilon_{Total}} {dt} = \frac {d\epsilon_{D}} {dt} + \frac {d\epsilon_{S}} {dt} = \frac {\sigma} {\eta} + \frac {1} {E} \frac {d\sigma} {dt}.

Under this model, if the material is put under a constant strain, the stresses gradually relax, When a material is put under a constant stress, the strain has two components. First, an elastic component occurs instantaneously, corresponding to the spring, and relaxes immediately upon release of the stress. The second is a viscous component that grows with time as long as the stress is applied. The Maxwell model predicts that stress decays exponentially with time, which is accurate for most polymers. One limitation of this model is that it does not predict creep accurately. The Maxwell model for creep or constant-stress conditions postulates that strain will increase linearly with time. However, polymers for the most part show the strain rate to be decreasing with time[2].

Application to soft solids:thermoplastic polymers in the vicinity of their melting temperature, fresh concrete ( neglecting its ageing), numerous metals at a temperature close to their melting point.

The general scheme is that an action potential arrives to depolarize the cell membrane. By mechanisms specific to the muscle type, this depolarization results in an increase in cytosolic calcium that is called a calcium transient. This increase in calcium activates calcium-sensitive contractile proteins that then use ATP to cause cell shortening.

Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is a term coined in 1952 to describe the physiological process of converting an electrical stimulus to a mechanical response [1]. This process is fundamental to muscle physiology, whereby the electrical stimulus is usually an action potential and the mechanical response is contraction. EC coupling can be dysregulated in many disease conditions.

Computer models can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including:

    * Stochastic or deterministic (and as a special case of deterministic, chaotic) - see External links below for examples of stochastic vs. deterministic simulations
    * Steady-state or dynamic
    * Continuous or discrete (and as an important special case of discrete, discrete event or DE models)
    * Local or distributed.

Equations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted.

    * Dynamic simulations model changes in a system in response to (usually changing) input signals.
    * Stochastic models use random number generators to model chance or random events;
    * A discrete event simulation (DES) manages events in time. Most computer, logic-test and fault-tree simulations are of this type. In this type of simulation, the simulator maintains a queue of events sorted by the simulated time they should occur. The simulator reads the queue and triggers new events as each event is processed. It is not important to execute the simulation in real time. It's often more important to be able to access the data produced by the simulation, to discover logic defects in the design, or the sequence of events.
    * A continuous dynamic simulation performs numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations or differential equations (either partial or ordinary). Periodically, the simulation program solves all the equations, and uses the numbers to change the state and output of the simulation. Applications include flight simulators, construction and management simulation games, chemical process modeling, and simulations of electrical circuits. Originally, these kinds of simulations were actually implemented on analog computers, where the differential equations could be represented directly by various electrical components such as op-amps. By the late 1980s, however, most ""analog"" simulations were run on conventional digital computers that emulate the behavior of an analog computer.
    * A special type of discrete simulation which does not rely on a model with an underlying equation, but can nonetheless be represented formally, is agent-based simulation. In agent-based simulation, the individual entities (such as molecules, cells, trees or consumers) in the model are represented directly (rather than by their density or concentration) and possess an internal state and set of behaviors or rules which determine how the agent's state is updated from one time-step to the next.
    * Distributed models run on a network of interconnected computers, possibly through the Internet. Simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred to as ""distributed simulations"". There are several standards for distributed simulation, including Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP), Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), the High Level Architecture (simulation) (HLA) and the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).

Background: Due to technical difficulties of in vivo observation of blood flow and microvessels in bone, no study has been done concerning the role of blood flow in bone remodeling.
Objective: To develop a new window chamber for microscopic observation of the microcirculation in living bone, and to examine the utility of the chamber using rat femur in health and diseases.
Methods: A stainless chamber (19 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height) with a circular window (7.5 mm in diameter) for microscopic observation was developed. The chamber was put on rat femur which was exposed for direct observation of the microvasculature. Intravital observation was made of bone blood flow and microvessels, using fluorescence videomicroscopy and confocal laser microscopy. The utility of the chamber was examined based on images of microcirculation (normal and abnormal) in the femur bone.
Results and conclusions: Images of rat femur microvasculature were enhanced in the quality by use of the femur window chamber. The new chamber provides a powerful tool for in vivo studies of the bone microcirculation in health and diseases.

For instance, the number of cities having a certain population size is found to vary as a power of the size of the population, and hence follows a power law. The distribution of a wide variety of natural and man-made phenomena follow a power law, including frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, sizes of craters on the moon and of solar flares, the sizes of power outages, earthquakes, and wars, the popularity of books and music, and many other quantities. ... A power law is any polynomial relationship that exhibits the property of scale invariance. The most common power laws relate two variables and have the form

    f(x) = ax^k\! +o(x^k),

where a and k are constants, and o(xk) is an asymptotically small function of xk. Here, k is typically called the scaling exponent, where the word ""scaling"" denotes the fact that a power-law function satisfies f(c x) \propto f(x) where c is a constant. ""

Detection is complicated as pathogens can evolve rapidly, and adapt to avoid the immune system and allow the pathogens to successfully infect their hosts.

http://purl.org/obo/owl/FBbi#FBbi_00000294,CCD detector,charge-coupled device,"A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved by ""shifting"" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins.

The CCD is a major technology for digital imaging. In a CCD image sensor, reverse-biased p n junctions (essentially photodiodes) are used to absorb photons and produce charges representing sensed pixels; the CCD is used to read out these charges. Although CCDs are not the only technology to allow for light detection, CCD image sensors are widely used in professional, medical, and scientific applications where high-quality image data is required.

http://sig.uw.edu/fma#Ribosome,ribosome,ribosomes,"A ribosome is a component of cells that assembles the twenty specific amino acid molecules to form the particular protein molecule determined by the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule.[1]

One of the central tenets of biology, often referred to as the central dogma of molecular biology, is that DNA is used to make RNA, which is used to make proteins. The DNA sequence in genes is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA). Ribosomes then read the information in this mRNA and use it to create proteins. This process is known as translation; the ribosome translates the genetic information from the RNA into proteins. Ribosomes do this by binding to an mRNA and using it as a template for determining the correct sequence of amino acids in a particular protein. The amino acids are attached to transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA sequence. The attached amino acids are then joined together by another part of the ribosome. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, ""reading"" its sequence and producing a corresponding chain of amino acids.

Ribosomes are made from complexes of RNAs and proteins called ribonucleoproteins. Ribosomes are divided into two subunits. The smaller subunit binds to the mRNA, while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA and the amino acids. When a ribosome finishes reading a mRNA, these two subunits split apart. Ribosomes have been classified as ribozymes, because the ribosomal RNA seems to be most important for the peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together.

Nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs)

Nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs) compose the first class of antiretroviral drugs developed. In order to be incorporated into the viral DNA, NRTIs must be activated in the cell by the addition of three phosphate groups to their deoxyribose moiety, to form NRTI triphosphates. This phosphorylation step is carried out by cellular kinase enzymes.

http://sig.uw.edu/fma#Anterior_communicating_artery,anterior communicating artery,anterior communicating arteries,"In human anatomy, the anterior communicating artery is a blood vessel of the brain that connects the left and right anterior cerebral arteries.

The anterior communicating artery connects the two anterior cerebral arteries across the commencement of the longitudinal fissure. Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining together to form a single trunk, which afterward divides; or it may be wholly, or partially, divided into two. Its length averages about 4 mm, but varies greatly. It gives off some of the anteromedial ganglionic vessels, but these are principally derived from the anterior cerebral artery.

It is part of the cerebral arterial circle, also known as the circle of Willis.

http://sig.uw.edu/fma#Muscle,muscle,muscle tissue|muscles,"Muscle (from Latin musculus, diminutive of mus ""mouse""[1]) is a contractile tissue of animals and is derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells. Muscle cells contain contractile filaments that move past each other and change the size of the cell. They are classified as skeletal, cardiac, or smooth muscles. Their function is to produce force and cause motion. Muscles can cause either locomotion of the organism itself or movement of internal organs. Cardiac and smooth muscle contraction occurs without conscious thought and is necessary for survival. Examples are the contraction of the heart and peristalsis which pushes food through the digestive system. Voluntary contraction of the skeletal muscles is used to move the body and can be finely controlled. Examples are movements of the eye, or gross movements like the quadriceps muscle of the thigh. There are two broad types of voluntary muscle fibers: slow twitch and fast twitch. Slow twitch fibers contract for long periods of time but with little force while fast twitch fibers contract quickly and powerfully but fatigue very rapidly.

As such, it provides one way of measuring the degree to which the geometry determined by a given Riemannian metric might differ from that of ordinary Euclidean n-space. More generally, the Ricci tensor is defined on any pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Like the metric itself, the Ricci tensor is a symmetric bilinear form on the tangent space of the manifold.

The Ricci curvature is broadly applicable to modern Riemannian geometry and general relativity theory. In connection with the latter, it is up to an overall trace term, the portion of the Einstein field equation representing the geometry of spacetime, the other significant portion of which comes from the presence of matter and energy. In connection with the former, lower bounds on the Ricci tensor on a Riemannian manifold allow one to extract global geometric and topological information by comparison (cf. comparison theorem) with the geometry of a constant curvature space form. If the Ricci tensor satisfies the vacuum Einstein equation, then the manifold is an Einstein manifold, which have been extensively studied (cf. Besse 1987). In this connection, the Ricci flow equation governs the evolution of a given metric to an Einstein metric, the precise manner in which this occurs ultimately leads to the solution of the Poincar conjecture.

The following equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as 1,2-diaminoethane, in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:

    T_A = [A] + [HA] +[H_2A] \,
    T_H = [H] + [HA] + 2[H_2A] - [OH] \,

With TA the total concentration of species A. Note that it is customary to omit the ionic charges when writing and using these equations.

When the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are specified there are two equations in two unknown ""free concentrations"" [A] and [H]. This follows from the fact that [HA]= 1

    T_A = [A] + \beta_1[A][H] + \beta_2[A][H]^2 \,
    T_H = [H] + \beta_1[A][H] + 2\beta_2[A][H]^2 - K_w[H]^{-1} \,

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000126,Fokker-Planck equation,,"The Fokker Planck equation describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the velocity of a particle, and can be generalized to other observables as well.[1] It is named after Adriaan Fokker[2] and Max Planck[3] and is also known as the Kolmogorov forward equation, named after Andrey Kolmogorov. When applied to particle position distributions, it is better known as the Smoluchowski equation.

The first consistent microscopic derivation of the Fokker Planck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed[4] by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Nikolay Krylov.[5]

In one spatial dimension x, the Fokker Planck equation for a process with drift D1(x,t) and diffusion D2(x,t) is

    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}f(x,t)=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ D_{1}(x,t)f(x,t)\right] +\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\left[ D_{2}(x,t)f(x,t)\right]. 

More generally, the time-dependent probability distribution may depend on a set of N macrovariables xi. The general form of the Fokker Planck equation is then

    \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \left[ D_i^1(x_1, \ldots, x_N) f \right] + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \, \partial x_j} \left[ D_{ij}^2(x_1, \ldots, x_N) f \right],

where D1 is the drift vector and D2 the diffusion tensor; the latter results from the presence of the stochastic force.

The equation of state of the universality class of the 3D Ising model is determined numerically in the critical domain from quantum field theory and renormalization group techniques. The starting point is the five loop perturbative expansion of the effective potential (or free energy) in the framework of renormalized 4 3 field theory. The 3D perturbative expansion is summed, using a Borel transformation and a mapping based on large order behaviour results. It is known that the equation of state has parametric representations which incorporate in a simple way its scaling and regularity properties. We show that such a representation can be used to accurately determine it from the knowledge of the few first coefficients of the expansion for small magnetization. Revised values of amplitude ratios are deduced. Finally we compare the 3D values with the results obtained by the same method from the "" = 4  d expansion.

It describes the flux of ions under the influence of both an ionic concentration gradient \nabla c and an electric field E=-\nabla \phi. It extends Fick's law of diffusion for the case where the diffusing particles are also moved with respect to the fluid by electrostatic forces.[1][2]

The Nernst Planck equation is given by:

\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left[ D \nabla c - u c + \frac{Dze}{k_B T}c\nabla \phi \right]

Where t is time, D is the diffusivity of the chemical species, c is the concentration of the species, and u is the velocity of the species, z is the valence of ionic species, e is the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

If the diffusing particles are themselves charged they influence the electric field on moving. Hence the Nernst Planck equation is applied in describing the ion-exchange kinetics in soils.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000129,Bloch equation,equation of motion of nuclear magnetization,"In physics and chemistry, specifically in NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or ESR (electron spin resonance) the Bloch equations are a set of macroscopic equations that are used to calculate the nuclear magnetization M = (Mx, My, Mz) as a function of time when relaxation times T1 and T2 are present. These are phenomenological equations that were introduced by Felix Bloch in 1946. [1] Sometimes they are called the equations of motion of nuclear magnetization. ...
Let M(t) = (Mx(t), My(t), Mz(t)) be the nuclear magnetization. Then the Bloch equations read:

    \frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t) ) _x - \frac {M_x(t)} {T_2}
    \frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t) ) _y - \frac {M_y(t)} {T_2}
    \frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t) ) _z - \frac {M_z(t) - M_0} {T_1}

where    is the gyromagnetic ratio and B(t) = (Bx(t), By(t), B0 +  Bz(t)) is the magnetic field experienced by the nuclei. The z component of the magnetic field B is sometimes composed of two terms:

    * one, B0, is constant in time,
    * the other one,  Bz(t), may be time dependent. It is present in magnetic resonance imaging and helps with the spatial decoding of the NMR signal.

M(t)   B(t) is the cross product of these two vectors. M0 is the steady state nuclear magnetization (that is, for example, when t ; it is in the z direction.

Although they can be formed by bond cleavage of longer segments, they are now more commonly synthesized, in a sequence-specific manner, from individual nucleoside phosphoramidites. Automated synthesizers allow the synthesis of oligonucleotides up to about 200 bases.

Oligonucleotides are characterized by the sequence of nucleotide residues that comprise the entire molecule. The length of the oligonucleotide is usually denoted by ""mer"" (from Greek meros, ""part""). For example, a fragment of 25 bases would be called a 25-mer. Oligonucleotides readily bind, in a sequence-specific manner, to their respective complementary oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA to form duplexes or, less often, hybrids of a higher order. This basic property serves as a foundation for the use of oligonucleotides as probes for detecting DNA or RNA. Examples of procedures that use oligonucleotides include DNA microarrays, Southern blots, ASO analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and the synthesis of artificial genes.

source: http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~physedu/mapletutorial/tutorials/diff_eqs/intro.html

The theory of differential equations is quite developed and the methods used to study them vary significantly with the type of the equation.

    * An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation in which the unknown function (also known as the dependent variable) is a function of a single independent variable. In the simplest form, the unknown function is a real or complex valued function, but more generally, it may be vector-valued or matrix-valued: this corresponds to considering a system of ordinary differential equations for a single function. Ordinary differential equations are further classified according to the order of the highest derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable appearing in the equation. The most important cases for applications are first-order and second-order differential equations. In the classical literature also distinction is made between differential equations explicitly solved with respect to the highest derivative and differential equations in an implicit form.

    * A partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation in which the unknown function is a function of multiple independent variables and the equation involves its partial derivatives. The order is defined similarly to the case of ordinary differential equations, but further classification into elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations, especially for second-order linear equations, is of utmost importance. Some partial differential equations do not fall into any of these categories over the whole domain of the independent variables and they are said to be of mixed type.

Both ordinary and partial differential equations are broadly classified as linear and nonlinear. A differential equation is linear if the unknown function and its derivatives appear to the power 1 (products are not allowed) and nonlinear otherwise. The characteristic property of linear equations is that their solutions form an affine subspace of an appropriate function space, which results in much more developed theory of linear differential equations. Homogeneous linear differential equations are a further subclass for which the space of solutions is a linear subspace i.e. the sum of any set of solutions or multiples of solutions is also a solution. The coefficients of the unknown function and its derivatives in a linear differential equation are allowed to be (known) functions of the independent variable or variables; if these coefficients are constants then one speaks of a constant coefficient linear differential equation.

There are very few methods of explicitly solving nonlinear differential equations; those that are known typically depend on the equation having particular symmetries. Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of chaos. Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for nonlinear PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases is considered to be a significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf. Navier
Linear differential equations frequently appear as approximations to nonlinear equations. These approximations are only valid under restricted conditions. For example, the harmonic oscillator equation is an approximation to the nonlinear pendulum equation that is valid for small amplitude oscillations (see below).

    * Monte Carlo simulation studies of physics processes at colliders.
    * Next-to-leading order calculations of particle production rates and distributions.
    * Extraction of parton distribution functions from data.
    * Application of heavy quark effective field theory to extract CKM matrix elements.
    * Using lattice QCD to extract quark masses and CKM matrix elements from experiment.
    * ""Phenomenological analyses,"" in which one studies the experimental consequences of adding the most general set of beyond-the-Standard-Model effects in a given sector of the Standard Model, usually parameterized in terms of anomalous couplings and higher-dimensional operators. In this case the term ""phenomenological"" is being used more in its philosophy of science sense.""

When a motor unit is activated, all of its fibers contract. Groups of motor units often work together to coordinate the contractions of a single muscle; all of the motor units that subserve a single muscle are considered a motor unit pool. Larger motor units have stronger twitch tensions.[1]

The number of muscle fibers within each unit can vary: thigh muscles can have a thousand fibers in each unit, eye muscles might have ten. In general, the number of muscle fibers innervated by a motor unit is a function of a muscle's need for refined motion. The smaller the motor unit, the more precise the action of the muscle. Muscles requiring more refined motion are innervated by motor units that synapse with fewer muscle fibers.

Nerve cell axons are very thin, about 1 micrometer. However, they are extraordinarily long. For many motor neurons the axon is over a meter long, extending from the spinal column to a muscle cell. They stretch the spinal column to increase height.

In medical electrodiagnostic testing for a patient with weakness, careful analysis of the motor unit action potential (MUAP) size, shape, and recruitment pattern can help in distinguishing a myopathy from a neuropathy.

The heart beat may be too fast or too slow, and may be regular or irregular.

Some arrhythmias are life-threatening medical emergencies that can result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. Others cause symptoms such as an abnormal awareness of heart beat (palpitations), and may be merely annoying. These palpitations have also been known to be caused by atrial/ventricular fibrillation, wire faults, and other technical or mechanical issues in cardiac pacemakers/defibrillators. Still others may not be associated with any symptoms at all, but may predispose the patient to potentially life threatening stroke or embolism.

Some arrhythmias are very minor and can be regarded as normal variants. In fact, most people will on occasion feel their heart skip a beat, or give an occasional extra strong beat; neither of these is usually a cause for alarm.[1]

Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. For example, high-viscosity felsic magma will create a tall, steep stratovolcano, because it cannot flow far before it cools, while low-viscosity mafic lava will create a wide, shallow-sloped shield volcano. All real fluids (except superfluids) have some resistance to stress and therefore are viscous, but a fluid which has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal fluid or inviscid fluid.

If a fluid with a viscosity of one Pa times s is placed between two plates, and one plate is pushed sideways with a shear stress of one pascal, it moves a distance equal to the thickness of the layer between the plates in one second.

The cgs physical unit for dynamic viscosity is the poise[8] (P), named after Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille. It is more commonly expressed, particularly in ASTM standards, as centipoise (cP). Water at 20 degrees C has a viscosity of 1.0020 cP or 0.001002 kg/(m times s).

It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the brain, lungs and heart. The biggest bone in the body is the femur in the thigh and the smallest is the stapes bone in the middle ear. In an adult, the skeleton comprises around 30-40% of the total body weight,[1] and half of this weight is water.

Fused bones include those of the pelvis and the cranium. Not all bones are interconnected directly: there are three bones in each middle ear called the ossicles that articulate only with each other. The hyoid bone, which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the tongue, does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments.

An equivalent two-dimensional method is called the marching squares algorithm.

The algorithm proceeds through the scalar field, taking eight neighbor locations at a time (thus forming an imaginary cube), then determining the polygon(s) needed to represent the part of the isosurface that passes through this cube. The individual polygons are then fused into the desired surface.

Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. ... The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems are the Navier Stokes equations, which define any single-phase fluid flow. These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing viscosity to yield the Euler equations. Further simplification, by removing terms describing vorticity yields the full potential equations. Finally, these equations can be linearized to yield the linearized potential equations. ...
In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed.

    * During preprocessing
          o The geometry (physical bounds) of the problem is defined.
          o The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non uniform.
          o The physical modeling is defined   for example, the equations of motions + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation
          o Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at the boundaries of the problem. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
    * The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient.
    * Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution.

This cytokine is produced primarily by monocytes and to a lesser extent by lymphocytes. This cytokine has pleiotropic effects in immunoregulation and inflammation. It down-regulates the expression of Th1 cytokines, MHC class II antigens, and costimulatory molecules on macrophages. It also enhances B cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production. This cytokine can block NF-?B activity, and is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Knockout studies in mice suggested the function of this cytokine as an essential immunoregulator in the intestinal tract.[2] and indeed patients with Crohn's disease react favorably towards treatment with bacteria producing recombinant interleukin 10, showing the importance of interleukin 10 for counteracting excessive immunity in the human body.[3]

A TLD measures ionizing radiation exposure by measuring the amount of visible light emitted from a crystal in the detector when the crystal is heated. The amount of light emitted is dependent upon the radiation exposure. Materials exhibiting thermoluminescence in response to ionizing radiation include but are not limited to calcium fluoride, lithium fluoride, calcium sulfate, lithium borate, calcium borate, potassium bromide and feldspar.

The two most common types of TLDs are calcium fluoride and lithium fluoride, with one or more impurities to produce trap states for energetic electrons. The former is used to record gamma exposure, the latter for gamma and neutron exposure (indirectly, using the Li-6 (n,alpha) nuclear reaction; for this reason, LiF dosimeters may be enriched in lithium-6 to enhance this effect or enriched in lithium-7 to reduce it). As the radiation interacts with the crystal it causes electrons in the crystal's atoms to jump to higher energy states, where they stay trapped due to intentionally introduced impurities (usually manganese or magnesium)[1] in the crystal, until heated. Heating the crystal causes the electrons to drop back to their ground state, releasing a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the trap state and the ground state. The electrons can also drop back to ground state after a long period of time; this effect is called fading and is dependent on the incident radiation energy and intrinsic properties of the TLD material. As a result, each material possesses a limited shelf life after which dosimetric information can no longer be obtained. This varies from several weeks in calcium fluoride to up to two years for lithium fluoride.

It can be used both for environmental monitoring and for staff personnel in facilities involving radiation exposure, among other applications.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000585,particle filter algorithm,sequential Monte Carlo algorithm|SMC algorithm|sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm,"In statistics, particle filters, also known as sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMC), are sophisticated model estimation techniques based on simulation. Particle filters have important applications in econometrics[1].

Particle filters are usually used to estimate Bayesian models in which the latent variables are connected in a Markov chain   similar to a hidden Markov model (HMM), but typically where the state space of the latent variables is continuous rather than discrete, and not sufficiently restricted to make exact inference tractable (as, for example, in a linear dynamical system, where the state space of the latent variables is restricted to Gaussian distributions and hence exact inference can be done efficiently using a Kalman filter). In the context of HMMs and related models, filtering refers to determining the distribution of a latent variable at a specific time, given all observations up to that time; particle filters are so named because they allow for approximate ""filtering"" (in the sense just given) using a set of ""particles"" (differently-weighted samples of the distribution).

Particle filters are the sequential ('on-line') analogue of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) batch methods and are often similar to importance sampling methods. Well-designed particle filters can often be much faster than MCMC. They are often an alternative to the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with the advantage that, with sufficient samples, they approach the Bayesian optimal estimate, so they can be made more accurate than either the EKF or UKF. However, when the simulated sample is not sufficiently large, they might suffer from sample impoverishment.

Particle filters have important applications in econometrics[1].

Particle filters are usually used to estimate Bayesian models in which the latent variables are connected in a Markov chain   similar to a hidden Markov model (HMM), but typically where the state space of the latent variables is continuous rather than discrete, and not sufficiently restricted to make exact inference tractable (as, for example, in a linear dynamical system, where the state space of the latent variables is restricted to Gaussian distributions and hence exact inference can be done efficiently using a Kalman filter). In the context of HMMs and related models, filtering refers to determining the distribution of a latent variable at a specific time, given all observations up to that time; particle filters are so named because they allow for approximate ""filtering"" (in the sense just given) using a set of ""particles"" (differently-weighted samples of the distribution).

Particle filters are the sequential ('on-line') analogue of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) batch methods and are often similar to importance sampling methods. Well-designed particle filters can often be much faster than MCMC. They are often an alternative to the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with the advantage that, with sufficient samples, they approach the Bayesian optimal estimate, so they can be made more accurate than either the EKF or UKF. However, when the simulated sample is not sufficiently large, they might suffer from sample impoverishment. The approaches can also be combined by using a version of the Kalman filter as a proposal distribution for the particle filter.

In this way, the tetrahedrons all share one of the main diagonals of the cube. Instead of the twelve edges of the cube, we now have nineteen edges: the original twelve, six face diagonals, and the main diagonal. Just like in marching cubes, the intersections of these edges with the iso surface are approximated by linearly interpolating the values at the grid points.

Adjacent cubes share all edges in the connecting face, including the same diagonal. This is an important property to prevent cracks in the rendered surface, because interpolation of the two distinct diagonals of a face usually gives slightly different intersection points. An added benefit is that up to five computed intersection points can be reused when handling the neighbor cube. This includes the computed surface normals and other graphics attributes at the intersection points.

Each tetrahedron has sixteen possible configurations, falling into three classes: no intersection, intersection in one triangle and intersection in two (adjacent) triangles.

The complex assembles on negatively charged phospholipid membranes in the presence of calcium ions. The prothrombinase complex catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (Factor II), an inactive zymogen, to thrombin (Factor IIa), an active serine protease. The activation of thrombin is a critical reaction in the coagulation cascade, which functions to regulate hemostasis in the body. To produce thrombin, the prothrombinase complex cleaves two peptide bonds in prothrombin, one after Arg271 and the other after Arg320.[1] Although it has been shown that Factor Xa can activate prothrombin when unassociated with the prothrombinase complex, the rate of thrombin formation is severely decreased under such circumstances. The prothrombinase complex can catalyze the activation of prothrombin at a rate 3 x 105-fold faster than can Factor Xa alone.[2] Thus, the prothrombinase complex is required for the efficient production of activated thrombin and also for adequate hemostasis.

A sensory system consists of sensory receptors, neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception.

In short, senses are transducers from the physical world to the realm of the mind.

The sensory system provides information that places the individual in relation to the environment. Sensation may be classified into categories by various methods dependent on anatomic or functional criteria. An anatomic classification divides sensory function into somatic and visceral components with general and special subgroups of each. Clinically, however, only somatic sensation is easily measured. One functional classification separates sensory modalities into simple affective sensations, termed protopathic, and sensations that provide discriminative analysis with regard to the environment, termed epicritic. A more practical scheme of classification was developed early in this century by Sherrington and remains the most useful for the clinician. This scheme utilizes both anatomic criteria including the types and locations of end organs and functional criteria such as the types of stimuli measured by each modality to separate exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensation. A third sensory modality requires cortical analysis to provide more complex interpretation of primary sensory information. All three types of sensation should be evaluated in every patient examined.

Loosely speaking, 1 year is the period of the Earth's orbit around the Sun,[1] and the Earth's rotation on its axis has a frequency of 1 rotation per day.[2] Frequency is also important in the Doppler Effect proposed in 1842 by Christian Doppler. This is used in radar, cooling machines, and predicting weather patterns.

unit: For cyclical processes, such as rotation, oscillations, or waves, frequency is defined as a number of cycles per unit time. In physics and engineering disciplines, such as optics, acoustics, and radio, frequency is usually denoted by a Latin letter f or by a Greek letter  (nu).

In SI units, the unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz), named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz: 1 Hz means that an event repeats once per second. A previous name for this unit was cycles per second.

A traditional unit of measure used with rotating mechanical devices is revolutions per minute, abbreviated RPM. 60 RPM equals one hertz.[3]

The period, usually denoted by T, is the length of time taken by one cycle, and is the reciprocal of the frequency f:

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000553,contour following algorithm,contour following algorithms,"Two distinct types of surface following can be defined according to component geometry. Complex parts that do not present any axis of symmetry, such as most turbine blades, require considering a full tri-dimensional knowledge of the component in order to control the transducer orientation; three-dimensional surface following capabilities are therefore required.

On the other hand, parts that do have an axis of symmetry, such as extrusions, represent a simplified case of the latter since they can be defined as the repetition of a 2-D contour along the extrusion axis. Surface following inspection of such parts can be achieved with an axis aligned with the axis of symmetry of the specimen and a 2-D surface follower. This type of surface following is sometimes referred to as 2 -D scanning, or simply contour following.


What is Contour Following? 
In the context of ultrasonic inspection, contour following can be described as a scanner s ability to do a controlled displacement of one or multiple axes, with the objective to move around a round, curved or inclined surface with constant transducer orientation and distance (water path). When contact inspection is performed, this can be relatively well achieved by a spring-loaded swiveling head as long as the part surface does not present large variations. However, when it comes to performing an inspection with an immersion or squirter system, the orientation of the transducer must be controlled with a high degree of precision in order to follow the part contour adequately. Of course, this must be accomplished without any collisions between the scanning head and the inspected specimen.

At least one rotational axis is required to perform noncontact contour following. The linear axes serve to move the transducer at the proper locations while the rotational axis is either used to maintain the proper ultrasonic wave entry angle or to rotate the part.

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_25555,nitrogen atom,nitrogen,"Nitrogen (play /'na?tr?d??n/ ny-tr?-jin) is a chemical element that has the symbol N, atomic number of 7 and atomic mass 14.00674 u. Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78.08% by volume of Earth's atmosphere.[1] The element nitrogen was discovered as a separable component of air, by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford, in 1772.

Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in breaking the bond to convert the N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas.

Nitrogen occurs in all living organisms, and the nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Synthetically produced nitrates are key ingredients of industrial fertilizers,[1] and also key pollutants in causing the eutrophication of water systems. Nitrogen is a constituent element of amino acids and thus of proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). It resides in the chemical structure of almost all neurotransmitters, and is a defining component of alkaloids, biological molecules produced by many organisms. The human body contains about 3% by weight of nitrogen, a larger fraction than all elements save oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.

It is a two equation model, that means, it includes two extra transport equations to represent the turbulent properties of the flow. This allows a two equation model to account for history effects like convection and diffusion of turbulent energy.

The first transported variable is turbulent kinetic energy, k. The second transported variable in this case is the turbulent dissipation, \epsilon. It is the variable that determines the scale of the turbulence, whereas the first variable, k, determines the energy in the turbulence.

There are two major formulations of K-epsilon models (see References 2 and 3). That of Launder and Sharma is typically called the ""Standard"" K-epsilon Model. The original impetus for the K-epsilon model was to improve the mixing-length model, as well as to find an alternative to algebraically prescribing turbulent length scales in moderate to high complexity flows.

""In medicine, a shunt is a hole or a small passage which moves, or allows movement of fluid from one part of the body to another. The term may describe either congenital or acquired shunts; and acquired shunts (sometimes referred to as iatrogenic shunts) may be either biological or mechanical.

    * Cardiac shunts may be described as right-to-left, left-to-right or bidirectional, or as systemic-to-pulmonary or pulmonary-to-systemic.

    * Cerebral shunt: In cases of hydrocephalus and other conditions that cause chronic increased intracranial pressure, a one-way valve is used to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and carry it to other parts of the body. This valve usually sits outside the skull, but beneath the skin, somewhere behind the ear.

    * Lumbar-peritoneal shunt: In cases of chronic increased intracranial pressure such as Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and Hydrocephalus, a tube or shunt with or without a one-way valve is used to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and transport it to the peritoneal cavity, which is a cavity located in the abdomen area of the body. This shunt is usually inserted in between two of the vertebrae in the lumbar and punctures the cerebrospinal fluid sack or lumbar subarachnoid space, it then runs beneath the skin to the peritoneal cavity, where it is eventually drained away by the normal bodily fluid drainage system. For an example of a Lumbar-peritoneal/Lumboperitoneal shunt.

    * A Peritoneovenous shunt: (also called Denver shunt[1]) is a shunt which drains peritoneal fluid from the peritoneum into veins, usually the internal jugular vein or the superior vena cava. It is sometimes used in patients with refractory ascites. It is a long tube with a non-return valve running subcutaneously from the peritoneum to the internal jugular vein in the neck, which allows ascitic fluid to pass directly into the systemic circulation

In Lagrangian mechanics, the trajectory of a system of particles is derived by solving the Lagrange equations in one of two forms, either the Lagrange equations of the first kind,[1] which treat constraints explicitly as extra equations, often using Lagrange multipliers;[2][3] or the Lagrange equations of the second kind, which incorporate the constraints directly by judicious choice of generalized coordinates.[1][4] The fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations shows that solving the Lagrange equations is equivalent to finding the path for which the action functional is stationary, a quantity that is the integral of the Lagrangian over time.""

Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such joint replacement orthopaedic surgery generally is conducted to relieve arthritis pain or fix severe physical joint damage as part of hip fracture treatment. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently the most common orthopaedic operation, though patient satisfaction short and long term varies widely.

Tipranavir has the ability to inhibit the replication of viruses that are resistant to other protease inhibitors and it recommended for patients who are resistant to other treatments. Resistance to tipranavir itself seems to require multiple mutations.[1]

Tipranavir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 22, 2005, and was approved for pediatric use on June 24, 2008.[2] Like lopinavir and atazanavir, it is very potent and is effective in salvage therapy for patients with some drug resistance. However, side effects of tipranavir can be more severe than other anti-retrovirals. Some side effects include intracranial hemorraging[citation needed], hepatitis[3], and diabetes mellitus[citation needed]. The drug has also been shown to cause increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides[citation needed].

Survival models relate the time that passes before some event occurs to one or more covariates that may be associated with that quantity.

For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure. Other types of survival models such as accelerated failure time models do not exhibit proportional hazards. These models could describe a situation such as a drug that reduces a subject's immediate risk of having a stroke, but where there is no reduction in the hazard rate after one year for subjects who do not have a stroke in the first year of analysis.

The values are most often tabulated at 25   degrees C. The basis for an electrochemical cell such as the galvanic cell is always a redox reaction which can be broken down into two half-reactions: oxidation at anode (loss of electron) and reduction at cathode (gain of electron). Electricity is generated due to electric potential difference between two electrodes. This potential difference is created as a result of the difference between individual potentials of the two metal electrodes with respect to the electrolyte.

Although the overall potential of a cell can be measured, there is no simple way to accurately measure the electrode/electrolyte potentials in isolation. The electric potential also varies with temperature, concentration and pressure. Since the oxidation potential of a half-reaction is the negative of the reduction potential in a redox reaction, it is sufficient to calculate either one of the potentials. Therefore, standard electrode potential is commonly written as standard reduction potential.

More formally, emf is the external work expended per unit of charge to produce an electric potential difference across two open-circuited terminals.[2][3] The electric potential difference is created by separating positive and negative charges, thereby generating an electric field.[4][5] The created electrical potential difference drives current flow if a circuit is attached to the source of emf. When current flows, however, the voltage across the terminals of the source of emf is no longer the open-circuit value, due to voltage drops inside the device due to its internal resistance.

Devices that can provide emf include voltaic cells, thermoelectric devices, solar cells, electrical generators, transformers, and even Van de Graaff generators.[2][6] In nature, emf is generated whenever magnetic field fluctuations occur through a surface. An example for this is the varying Earth magnetic field during a geomagnetic storm, acting on anything on the surface of the planet, like an extended electrical grid.

A model with both fixed effects and random effects is called a mixed-effects model.
Mixed-effects models are primarily used to describe relationships between a response viable and some covariates in data that are grouped according to one or more classification factors. Examples of such grouped data include longitudinal data, repeated measures data, multilevel data, and block designs. By associating common random effects to observations sharing the same level of classification factor, mixed-effects model flexibly represent the covariance structure induced by the grouping of the data.

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000033,day,days,"A day is traditionally defined as the span of time it takes for the Earth or a celestial body (such as an other planet or a moon) to make a single rotation with respect to a star, measured most accurately from local noon to local noon. With a view to a far star assumed as fixed, this stellar day could be equivalent to one entire rotation of the body upon itself; in view of the Sun being the central star, this solar day does not equal a whole rotation period around the body's axis (obversely, the motion of revolving around the Sun would perform one day within an orbital period by its own without any spinning). Because celestial orbits are not perfectly circular, and thus objects travel at different speeds at various positions in their orbit, a solar day is not of the same length of time throughout the orbital period, in the course of a year. An additional disparity derives from the fact that the rotation periods, for instance of Earth's spin, are not exactly the same, mainly as a result of tidal effects.
The average length of a solar day on Earth is about 86,400 seconds (24 hours), and, until 1967, other smaller units of time (hour, minute, and second) were defined as specific fractions of the solar year for 1900. In 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light, and it became the SI base unit of time. The measurement unit of time called ""day"", defined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized d is not an SI unit, but it is accepted for use with SI.[1] It equates to the civil day, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time UTC.
However, the solar day on Earth is a natural phenomenon a lot of species refer to, when they constitute patterns of proceeding and the like circadian rhythms.

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000036,year,years,"A year (from Old English gear) is the orbital period of the Earth moving around the Sun. For an observer on Earth, this corresponds to the period it takes the Sun to complete one course throughout the zodiac along the ecliptic.

In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time, defined as 365.25 days of 86,400 SI seconds each.[1]

There is no universally accepted symbol for the year as a unit of time. The International System of Units does not propose one. A common abbreviation in international use is a (for Latin annus), in English also y or yr.

Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by changes in weather, hours of daylight, and consequently vegetation and fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions, generally four seasons are recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter, astronomically marked by the Sun reaching the points of equinox and solstice, although the climatic seasons lag behind their astronomical markers. In some tropical and subtropical regions it is more common to speak of the rainy (or wet, or monsoon) season versus the dry season.

A calendar year is an approximation of the Earth's orbital period in a given calendar. A calendar year in the Gregorian calendar (as well as in the Julian calendar) has either 365 (common years) or 366 (leap years) days.

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000835,viscosity equation,,"Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed by either shear stress or tensile stress. In everyday terms (and for fluids only), viscosity is ""thickness"" or ""internal friction"". Thus, water is ""thin"", having a lower viscosity, while honey is ""thick"", having a higher viscosity. Put simply, the less viscous the fluid is, the greater its ease of movement (fluidity).[1]

Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. For example, high-viscosity felsic magma will create a tall, steep stratovolcano, because it cannot flow far before it cools, while low-viscosity mafic lava will create a wide, shallow-sloped shield volcano. All real fluids (except superfluids) have some resistance to stress and therefore are viscous, but a fluid which has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal fluid or inviscid fluid.

http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/NCIM/C0231452,flexion,bending,"In anatomy, flexion (from the Latin word flectere, to bend[1]) is a position that is made possible by the joint angle decreasing. The skeletal (bones, cartilage, and ligaments) and muscular (muscles and tendons) systems work together to move the joint into a ""flexed"" position. For example the elbow is flexed when the hand is brought closer to the shoulder. The trunk may be flexed toward the legs or the neck to the chest.

The opposite term is extension, or straightening. Flexion decreases the angle between the bones of the limb at a joint, and extension increases it.

Note that specific flexion activities may occur only along the sagittal plane, i.e. from the forward to backward direction, and not side-to-side direction, which is further discussed in abduction.

In its most common form, an equivalent circuit is made up of linear, passive elements. However, more complex equivalent circuits are used that approximate the nonlinear behavior of the original circuit as well. These more complex circuits often are called macromodels of the original circuit. An example of a macromodel is the Boyle circuit for the 741 operational amplifier.[1]

There are two very renowned two-terminal equivalent circuits:

    * Th venin equivalent - reduces a two-terminal circuit to a single voltage source and a series Th venin impedance
    * Norton equivalent - reduces a two terminal circuit to a current source and a parallel Norton impedance

For a restricted set of linear four-terminal circuits, equivalent two-port networks can be set up. The restriction upon a two-port representation is that of a port: the current entering each port must be the same as the current leaving that port.[2] By linearizing a nonlinear circuit about its operating point, such a two-port representation can be made for transistors: see hybrid pi and h-parameter circuits.

Equivalent circuits also can describe and model the electrical properties of materials or biological systems like the cell membrane. The latter is modelled as a capacitor (i.e. the lipid bilayer) in parallel with resistance-battery combinations (i.e. ion channels powered by an ion gradient across the membrane).""

""Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a fluid which is being deformed by either shear stress or tensile stress.

Put simply, the less viscous the fluid is, the greater its ease of movement (fluidity).[1]

Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. For example, high-viscosity felsic magma will create a tall, steep stratovolcano, because it cannot flow far before it cools, while low-viscosity mafic lava will create a wide, shallow-sloped shield volcano. All real fluids (except superfluids) have some resistance to stress and therefore are viscous, but a fluid which has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal fluid or inviscid fluid.

The study of flowing matter is known as rheology, which includes viscosity and related concepts.""

http://scai.fraunhofer.de/HuPSON#SCAIVPH_00000143,Scherrer equation,,"A shape factor is used in x-ray diffraction and crystallography to correlate the size of sub-micrometre particles, or crystallites, in a solid to the broadening of a peak in a diffraction pattern. In the Scherrer equation,

    \tau = \frac {K \lambda}{\beta \cos \theta}

where K is the shape factor,   

It is important to realize that the Scherrer formula provides a lower bound on the particle size. The reason for this is that a variety of factors can contribute to the width of a diffraction peak; besides crystallite size, the most important of these are usually inhomogeneous strain and instrumental effects. If all of these other contributions to the peak width were zero, then the peak width would be determined solely by the crystallite size and the Scherrer formula would apply. If the other contributions to the width are non-zero, then the crystallite size can be larger than that predicted by the Scherrer formula, with the ""extra"" peak width coming from the other factors.

VO2 max is expressed either as an absolute rate in litres of oxygen per minute (l/min) or as a relative rate in millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of bodyweight per minute (ml/kg/min), the latter expression is often used to compare the performance of endurance sports athletes. A less size-biased measure is to divide by \sqrt[3]{mass^2} rather than mass. ... VO2 max is properly defined by the Fick equation:

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_37246,elemental sodium,,"Sodium (play /'so?di?m/ soh-dee-?m) is a chemical element with the symbol Na and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal and is a member of the alkali metals; its only stable isotope is 23Na.

Elemental sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. It does not occur naturally on Earth, instead quickly reacting in air[2] and water, so it must be stored in a non-oxidizing medium such as a liquid hydrocarbon. The free metal is used for some chemical syntheses, analyses, and heat transfer applications.

The Na+ ion is soluble in water, and is thus present in significant quantities in the Earth's bodies of water; here, it is neutered by the chloride ion, causing evaporated ocean water solids to consist mostly of sodium chloride. The same ion is also a component of many minerals, such as sodium nitrate. Due to this solubility of the sodium ion in water, it is relatively scarce on land, and gets leached into water by rainfall.

Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. In animals, sodium ions are used against potassium ions to build up charges on cell membranes, allowing transmission of nerve impulses when the charge is dissipated; hence, it is thus classified as a dietary inorganic macro-mineral.

Used in physics (specifically quantum mechanics), it is an equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes in time. In the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, the quantum state, also called a wavefunction or state vector, is the most complete description that can be given to a physical system. Solutions to Schroedinger's equation describe not only molecular, atomic, and subatomic systems, but also macroscopic systems, possibly even the whole universe.[1]

The most general form is the time-dependent Schroedinger equation, which gives a description of a system evolving with time. For systems in a stationary state (i.e., where the Hamiltonian is not explicitly dependent on time), the time-independent Schroedinger equation is sufficient. Approximate solutions to the time-independent Schroedinger equation are commonly used to calculate the energy levels and other properties of atoms and molecules.

PBPK modeling is used in pharmaceutical research and development, and in health risk assessment.

PBPK models strive to be mechanistic by mathematically transcribing anatomical, physiological, physical, and chemical descriptions of the phenomena involved in the complex ADME processes. Some degree of residual simplification and empiricism is still present in those models, but they have an extended domain of applicability compared to that of classical, empirical function based, pharmacokinetic models. Given that property, PBPK models may have purely predictive uses, but other uses, such as statistical inference, have been made possible by the development of Bayesian statistical tools able to deal with complex models (see Gelman et al. 1996). That is true for both toxicity risk assessment and therapeutic drug development.

PBPK models try to rely a priori on the anatomical and physiological structure of the body. These are usually also multi-compartment models, but the compartments correspond to predefined organs or tissues, for which the interconnections correspond to blood or lymph flows (more rarely to diffusions). A system of differential equations can still be written, but its parameters represent blood flows, pulmonary ventilation rate, organ volumes etc., for which information is available in scientific publications. Indeed the description of the body is simplified and a balance needs to be struck between complexity and simplicity. Besides the advantage of allowing the recruitment of a priori information about parameter values, these models also facilitate inter-species transpositions or extrapolation from one mode of administration to another (e.g., inhalation to oral).

Ulcers can result in complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and even subcutaneous fat. Ulcers are most common on the skin of the lower extremities and in the gastrointestinal tract. An ulcer that appears on the skin is often visible as an inflamed tissue with an area of reddened skin. A skin ulcer is often visible in the event of exposure to heat or cold, irritation, or a problem with blood circulation. They can also be caused due to a lack of mobility, which causes prolonged pressure on the tissues. This stress in the blood circulation is transformed to a skin ulcer, commonly known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers. [1] Ulcers often become infected, and pus forms.

It is related to hemoglobin, which is the iron- and oxygen-binding protein in blood, specifically in the red blood cells. The only time myoglobin is found in the bloodstream is when it is released following muscle injury. It is an abnormal finding, and can be diagnostically relevant when found in blood. [2]
