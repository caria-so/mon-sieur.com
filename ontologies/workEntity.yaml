    description: "The volume brings together and comments for the first time on the three fundamental texts of the ceremonial magical tradition: the Key of Solomon, the Lemegeton and the Testament, whose task was to evoke the discarnate infernal and celestial entities. To this end, the ancient original iconography was recovered to reconstruct the seals and talismans and restore from the Hebrew the correct version of the supernatural names, upset over the centuries by the ignorance of the copyists. This second critical edition of the Solomonic texts contains copious explanatory material on the meaning of rituals and the related indispensable practices of meditation and contemplation."
